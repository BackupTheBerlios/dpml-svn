 
To build the DPML suite - please following the following procedure:

  a) define the DPML_HOME environment variable 
  b) build the bootstrap resources
  c) build the main DPML system

A. Setup Environment
--------------------

Pull down the sources:

  $ cd dev
  $ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/dpml/trunk dpml

The full sources to the DPML SDK are now present in the directory dev/dpml.  
On linux you need to execute a bash script to setup som environment variables
that declare a local DPML_SYSTEM into which we will generate the new binaries.
You can do this using the following command:

  $ cd dpml
  $ source setup.sh

On Windows you should define the DPML_SYSTEM environment variable and ensure
that $DPML_SYSTEM/bin is included in you PATH environment variable.
B. Bootstrap Build
------------------

Invoke the bootstrap build procedure.

On Linux:

  $ bash bootstrap

On Windows:
  $ bootstrap

C. Main System Build
--------------------

The bootstrap procedure will create a number of executables under 
%DPML_SYSTEM%/bin.  Several options are available concerning version 
handling of the full build.

  a) SNAPSHOT

     To create a SNAPSHOT build, use the following command:

     $ build

  b) Explict build versioning:

     To create a versioned build using an explicit build id, use:

     $ build -version ABC

  c) Decimal versioning (release mode).

     To create a versioned build using major, minor and micro 
     version values declared in project defintions (as is typically 
     used in release generation), use:

     $ build -decimal

The build procedure will build approximately 56 projects during which a number 
of downloads will occur.  On completion the %DPML_HOME%\data\dist directory will
contain the distribution archives for the installation.  Unpack the archive 
corresponding to your platform into the %DPML_HOME% root directory.
