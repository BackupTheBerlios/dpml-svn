 
To build the DPML suite - please following the following procedure:

  a) define the DPML_HOME environment variable 
  b) build the bootstrap resources
  c) build the main DPML system

A. Setup Environment
--------------------

Pull down the sources:

  $ cd dev
  $ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/dpml/trunk dpml

B. Build the bootstrap resources
--------------------------------

B.1 - Linux

  $ cd dpml
  $ bash bootstrap.sh

B.2 - Windows

Define the DPML_SYSTEM environment variable and ensure
that $DPML_SYSTEM/bin is included in you PATH environment variable. The 
DPML_SYSTEM variable value should point to the directory into which bootstrap
runtime artifacts such as the build, metro and station executable will be 
installed.  For example - C:\system\dpml

  $ cd dpml
  $ bootstrap

C. Main System Build
--------------------

The build procedure will build approximately 56 projects during which a number 
of downloads will occur.  

C.1 On Linux

  $ bash release.sh

  On completion a Debian installation will be created under the target/dist 
  directory.  This can be installed as a new or updated installation via standard
  Debian package installation tools.  For example:

  $ sudo dpkg -i dpml-sdk_2.1.1-1_all.deb

C.2 - Windows

  $ build clean install -decimal

  On completion the %DPML_HOME%\data\dist directory will
  contain the distribution archives for the installation.  Unpack the archive 
  corresponding to your platform into the %DPML_HOME% root directory or invoke 
  the NSIS installer.
