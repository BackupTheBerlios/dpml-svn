 
To build the DPML suite - please following the following procedure:

  a) define the DPML_HOME environment variable 
  b) build the bootstrap resources
  c) build the main DPML system

A. Setup Environment
--------------------

Declare an environment variable DPML_HOME referencing the location you want 
for the system installation (for example C:\system\dpml) and add 
%DPML_HOME%\share\bin to you PATH definition.

B. Bootstrap Build
------------------

Create a directory to hold the svn codebase (e.g. c:\dev\dpml\main), checkout 
the sources, cd to the main directory and invoke the bootstrap build procedure.
The bootstrap procedure invokes a SNAPSHOT build on all resources necessary to
establish the build tool.

  $ cd dev\dpml\main
  $ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/dpml/trunk/main
  $ bootstrap

C. Main System Build
--------------------

The bootstrap procedure will create a number of executables under 
%DPML_HOME%/share/bin.  To successfull invoke the build command the bin 
directory must be included in your PATH environment variable.

Several options are now available concerning version handling of the 
full build.

  a) SNAPSHOT

     To create a SNAPSHOT build, use the following command:

     $ build

  b) Explict build versioning:

     To create a versioned build using an explicit build id, use:

     $ build -version ABC

  c) Decimal versioning (release mode).

     To create a versioned build using major, minor and micro 
     version values declared in project defintions (as is typically 
     used in release generation), use:

     $ build -decimal

The build procedure will build approximately 42 projects during which a number 
of downloads may occur.  On completion the %DPML_HOME%\data\dist directory will
contain the distribution archives for the installation.  Unpack the archive 
corresponding to your platform into the %DPML_HOME% root directory.
