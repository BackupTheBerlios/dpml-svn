--------------

1. Processor Abstraction

   Processor abstraction with dpml-library-main.  Current the Depot Library 
   interfaces include the notion of a processor defintion and a relationship
   between project type production and the process used.  In fact this 
   relationship is a build system implementation concern and as such should 
   not appear in the library.  Instead the notion of processor needs to be 
   morphed into Listener defintions within the dpml-tools-builder package which 
   in-turn implies that the depot-ant package needs to handle its own 
   configuration.

   RESOLVED

2. Build System Declaration

   Current implementation allows for the defintion of a build system 
   implementation to be used by the builder when invoking a build 
   sequence.  While allowing for the potential of replaceable build 
   strategies, the implementation needs to be extended to supporting 
   multiple coexistant build strategies with defintion at the library,
   module and/or project levels.

3. Part datatypes are currently loded directly via XML.  This need to 
   be updated to enforce packaging of the encoded XML with a manifest 
   detailing the controller URI, version support etc.

   LATER

4. Add support for the configuration of a top-level component.
