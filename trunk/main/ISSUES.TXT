1. Build System Declaration

   Current implementation allows for the defintion of a build system 
   implementation to be used by the builder when invoking a build 
   sequence.  While allowing for the potential of replaceable build 
   strategies, the implementation needs to be extended to supporting 
   multiple coexistant build strategies with defintion at the library,
   module and/or project levels.
