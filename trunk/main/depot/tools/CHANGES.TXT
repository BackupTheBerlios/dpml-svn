
Changes in 2.0 (pre)
====================

net.dpml.tools.impl 
-------------------

1. removed presumption of source and target versions
   int the Javac task (was linked to 1.4, now requires 
   developer to declare constraints as build properties
   if required - i.e. we now default to the javac tool
   policy)
2. general code implovement via generics
3. rationalization of the <type> production element
    - removal of custom in-line type declaration
      in favour of:
        <type id="part" source="plugin.xml"/>
    - support for test verus production types, where
      test-based resources go to the target/test 
      directory and are not included as formal 
      project deliverables - e.g.:
        <type id="jar" test="true"/>
