Local preference resource protocol handler.
The local package holds a protocol handler that resolves uri references to content
under the ${dpml.prefs} directory.  A uri such as "local:template:magic/standard" is 
equivalent to the following file path: ${dpml.prefs}/magic/templates/standard.template.  
The handler's primary function is to allow references to ${dpml.prefs) content without 
the prerequisite of symbolic substitution by a controlling application.
