
Transit system changes under the 2.X branch:

  1. removed transit/console during refactoring (it may come back but if it does it will
     be different).  Transit configuration updates will be performed via JMX but additional 
     work is needed on storing configuration state and state mutation operations on 
     respective managers.

  2. removes registry protocol handler package (was never documented and is not needed with 
     JMX implementation)

  3. moved layout classes to net.dpml.transit package scope

  4. removed net/dpml/transit/model classes (remote management will be deliverered via JMX 
     MXBeans)

  5. consolidated the net/dpml/transit/monitor classes as internal concerns within Transit

  6. updated transit configuration to remove codebase abstraction on the grounds that 
     we can use java.util.ServiceLoader under SE6 to resolve custom layouts

  7. update artifact and local connection handler to use java.util.ServiceLoader for 
     loading of custom content handlers
