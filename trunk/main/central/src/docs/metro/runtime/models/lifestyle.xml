      <p>
      A lifestyle policy has a direct impact on the number of instances
      of a component that are created by the runtime.  The following table 
      list the semantics of the respective lifestyle policies.
      </p>

      <table>

        <tr>
          <th>Policy</th><th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><tt>SINGLETON</tt></td>
          <td>
          The <tt>SINGLETON</tt> lifestyle policy dictates that only 
          a single runtime instance will be created for the given 
          component.  Components requesting the <tt>SINGLETON</tt> must
          declare themselves as thread-safe capable. In effect the 
          <tt>SINGLETON</tt> instance will be shared across multiple 
          potentially concurrent threads.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>THREAD</tt></td>
          <td>
          The <tt>THREAD</tt> lifestyle policy dictates that a new 
          runtime instance of a component will be created per-identified 
          thread.  As such, requests for service access by objects within
          the same thread will share the same instance reference.  If a 
          request is received from a new thread then a new instance of the 
          component will be established and served to the requesting client.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>TRANSIENT</tt></td>
          <td>
          The <tt>TRANSIENT</tt> lifestyle policy dictates that a new 
          component instance will be created for every request.
          </td>
        </tr>

      </table>
    
      <subsection name="Default Policy">

      <p>
      If the component type declares itself as thread-safe capable the 
      default policy will be <tt>SINGLETON</tt> otherwise the <tt>THREAD</tt>
      policy will be assigned.
