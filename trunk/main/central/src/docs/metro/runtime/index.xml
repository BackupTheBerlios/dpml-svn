      <p>
      The Metro Runtime is an application that implements a multi-layered system model.
      The following illustration depicts the principal sub-system (higher level blocks 
      are dependent on immediate low-lever blocks).

        <p>
        A <tt>part</tt> is a network accessible datatype
        that associates a controller with a component deployment profile. The 
        deloyment profile references a component type.  The component type may
        be implementated using a collection of local or remote component parts.
        The Metro API defines concrete datatypes for component type defintions, 
        deployment scenarios, and an extended management model.

            located under a &lt;classname&gt;.type - a serializable datatype 
            containing information about a component class including characteristics 
            such as the services provided by the component, the context 
            assumptions asserted by the implementation, logging assumptions
            and defaults, etc.  A type may also contain an implemention description
            in the form of a collection of internal parts.  This information is cached 
            under the <tt>.type</tt> resource (an XML document encoded to JSR-57) for 
            use by deployment tools and the runtime system.

            the default deployment profile for a component including the definition of 
            the component inital context, dependency solutions, and any related 
            configuration information.  The <tt>part</tt> serves as the initial data 
            used to establish a component model.

        <p>
        The Part API is the core API dealing with component composition and is 
        central to the platforms ability to support concurrent deployment of different 
        container implementations.  The Metro system is the reference implementation
        of the Part API.

        <p>
        Using a network accessible <tt>part</tt>, the Metro 
        runtime provides support for the creation of a <tt>Component</tt> via 
        a <tt>Controller</tt>. The <tt>Component</tt> handles scopped requests 
        for locating service providers and establishment of managed 
        <tt>Instance</tt>(s).
