      <p>
      A <tt>Component</tt> is responsible for the management of a set 
      of service provider <tt>Instance</tt>(s).  The number of instances
      managed by a component is implementation dependent.  The reference
      implementation maintains instances relative to the associated 
      <a href="../parts/lifestyle.html">lifestyle</a> and 
      <a href="../parts/collection.html">collection</a> policies. For 
      example, a component declaring the <tt>SINGLETON</tt> collection 
      policy will have a 0..1 <tt>Instance</tt> association.  The lifetime
      of the instance will be a function of the associated collection 
      policy and usage contitions.
      </p>

      <p>
      An <tt>Instance</tt> provides the following functions:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>access to the concrete provider instance with support
            for isolution of the instance within a proxy exposing 
            only the service interfaces</li>
        <li>access to the provider <a href="state.html">state</a>
            and as a consequence the available transitions and 
            dynamic mangement operations</li>
      </ol>
