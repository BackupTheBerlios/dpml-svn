      <p>
      Component profiles include the defintion of a classloader chain.  The
      chain is defined by a series of classloader directives.  Each classloader
      directive is associated with a classloader category.  The following table 
      list the available classloading categories and their respective semantics.

        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>A public classloader typically contains the public service API
            of a component.

        <tr>
          <td><tt>PROTECTED</tt></td>
          <td>The protected classloader is created as a child of the public
            classloader and is typically used as the parent classloader for 
            component handlers that require access to parent componets (e.g.
            during assembly processes).</td>

          <td>A private classloader is constructed as a child of the protected
          classloader and is normally not exposed any forign controller or 
          component.</td>
