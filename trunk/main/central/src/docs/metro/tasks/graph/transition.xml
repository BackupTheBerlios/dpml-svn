        <p>
        The transition datatype descripes a transition from the current 
        state to a new target state. The transition may declare a nested 
        operation that will be invoked prior to the application of the 
        state transition.  A side effect of a state transtion is that 
        active state will be changed to the target of the transition which
        in-turn changes the defintion of the active state path (the 
        set of states from the root to the activie state).  This will 
        typically result in changes to available transition and 
        management operations.
