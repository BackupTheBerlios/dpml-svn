        The following example assumes that the demo application is up and running.  The 
        initial command line establishes a console connected to the named appplication.
        Within the console the user can query the status of the application and review available
        state transitions and management operations published by the component.  The following
        example demonstrates the invocation of the management operation <tt>'stats'</tt> on
        the component and the listing of the returned value.
