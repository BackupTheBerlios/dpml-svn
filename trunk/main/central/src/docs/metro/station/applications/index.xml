      <p>
      An application in the context of the Station is a remotely 
      reachable object established by the station controller that 
      holds information about an application process.  It exposes 
      operations though which the underlying profile is accesses,
      infomation about the application process identity, and 
      operations supporting the statup, restart, and shutdown of
      the application.
