       Metro is component runtime solution. It handles the composition 
       and deployment of component-based applications. First and 
       foremost Metro is an IOC Container (<a href="concepts/ioc.html">Inversion Of
       Control</a>) but perhaps more interesting is the support within Metro for 
       the notion of component driven <a href="concepts/ioc.html">Context 
       Awareness</a> combined with an <a href="concepts/management.html">Active 
       Mangement</a>, <a href="concepts/model.html">Model Driven</a>, 
       <a href="concepts/parts.html">Part Based</a> system arctitecture.
