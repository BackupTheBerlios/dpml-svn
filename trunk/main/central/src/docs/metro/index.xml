       <p>
       Metro is component runtime solution. It handles that isues related 
       to application deployment and it handles the issues related to composition
       and management of components that make up an application. Metro does these
       things using some strait-forward and simple concepts.  First and 
       foremost Metro is an IOC Container (<a href="concepts/ioc.html">Inversion Of
       Control</a>) but perhaps more interesting is the support with Metro for 
       the notion of component driven <a href="concepts/ioc.html">Context 
       Awareness</a> combined with an <a href="concepts/management.html">Active 
       Mangement</a>, <a href="concepts/model.html">Model Driven</a>, 
       <a href="concepts/parts.html">Part Based</a> system arctitecture.
