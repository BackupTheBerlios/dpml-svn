      <p>
      As part of an overral risk-reduction strategy concerning product 
      evolution Metro incorporates an internal controller
      management model that enables concurrent execution of different 
      container versions within a single application.  This strategy
      enables changes that would normally be classed as breaking 
      compatibility to be isolated in dynamicaly loaded plugin control 
      subsystems.  The end-result is the potential for a composite 
      comoponent to operate seamlessly with components using radicaly 
      different controllers.

      This is achived through the combinaton of:

        <li>Layered internal container APIs.</li>
        <li>Component deployment data tagged with supporting system version</li>
        <li>Dynamic loading of plugin controllers</li>
        <li>Controller delegation rules</li>
