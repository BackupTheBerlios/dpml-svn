      <p>
      A "Model Driven" system is a system within which a central model is 
      the definiative source for runtime information.  Within Metro the complete
      deployment scenario including the component type internal datastructure
      is represented as a remotely accessible model.  Modification of the model 
      via local or remote invocations may have a direct impact on the application 
      deployment or runtime state.  Metro provides a suite of interfaces dealing 
      with remote control of of the component state machine, activation policy, 
      garbage collection policies, context state, and redepoloyment scenario 
      information (including control over component configuration, parameterization, 
      and individual context entry settings).
