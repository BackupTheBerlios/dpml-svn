        <p>
        Layered above the Transit artifact protocol handler is a system that
        provides support for the creation of classloaders.  Classloaders are
        described under a 'plugin' file which is basically a list of dependent
        artifact uris and their location in the classloader hierarchy.  The
        plugin file is itself normally referenced as an artifact which means
        that the list is itself versioned, named, associated with a group, and
        dynamically resolvable.
        </p>

        <p><i>Example classloader descriptor artifact uri:</i></p>

        <code>@METRO-TOOLS-URI@</code>

        <p>
        The plugin file declares <tt>PUBLIC</tt>, <tt>PROTECTED</tt> and <tt>PRIVATE</tt>
        classloaders where each classloader is defined in terms of jar artifact uris.  
        Transit uses this information to construct a classloader chain.
        </p>

        <p>
        Plugin files use a XML file format to declare features of
        of the classloader, including information used when resolving plugins.
        This information is normally created automatically using the
        <a href="/depot/tasks/plugin.html">Plugin Builder</a> from the
        <a href="/depot/tools/index.html">Depot</a> build system.
        </p>

        <p>
        The following code fragment demonstrates the relatively simple process of
        creating a new classloader using Transit.
        </p>

<source>
URI uri = new URI( "artifact:part:dpml/examples/hello/hello-world#1.0.0" );
Part part = Part.load( uri );
ClassLoader classloader = part.getClassloader();
</source>

        <p>
        The following code fragment demonstrates the equivalent functionality
        using strict Java core classes.
        </p>

<source>
URI uri = new URI( "artifact:part:dpml/examples/hello/hello-world#1.0.0" );
URL url = uri.toURL();
ClassLoader classloader = (ClassLoader) url.getContent( new Class[]{ ClassLoader.class } );
</source>
