        <p>
        In addition to the structural classloader information - the plugin file
        may contain the declaration of a main class or an internal resource and
        namespace. The resource path information is a special case used within the
        Magic build system to support dynamic task loading.  The main class
        declaration is the entry point for classic plugin class loading relative
        to an established classloader.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Transit repository service provides support for class creation and
        object instantiation.  Class creation is typically used by applications
        that handle a particular semantics concerning a plugin model whereas
        the Transit object instantiation provides a simple but flexible model
        suitable for control over selectable sub-system strategies (e.g. the
        loading of a logging system or application runtime).
        </p>

        <p>
        The following code fragments demonstrates the creation of a plugin instance
        using Transit's standard plugin loader.
        </p>

        <p>
          We create a API project called hello-api, which contains the following
          interface.
        </p>
<source>
/**
 * API of the Hello service.
 */
public interface Hello
{
    void announce();
}
</source>
        <p>
          And then we need an implementation of the API, and we call that
          hello-impl.
        </p>
<source>
/**
 * Implementation of the Hello API.
 */
public class HelloImpl
    implements Hello
{
    private String m_message;

    public Hello( String message )
    {
        m_message = message;
    }

    public void announce()
    {
        System.out.println( m_message );
    }
}
</source>

   <p>
    so we need to do the following from the class that loads the plugin;
   </p>

<source>
  Repository repository = Transit.getInstance().getRepository();
  ClassLoader parent = getClass().getClassLoader();
  URI uri = new URI( "artifact:plugin:mycompany/thisproject/hello-impl#1.4.1" );
  Object[] args = new Object[] { "Hello, World!" };
  Object plugin = repository.getPlugin( parent, uri, args );
  if( plugin instanceof Hello )
  {
      m_hello = (Hello) plugin;
  }
  else
  {
      throw Exception( "Loaded plugin is not of the right type." );
  }
  :
  :
  :
  m_hello.announce();
</source>
        <p>
          For this to work, you will also need to create the plugin meta
          descriptor. The easiest way is to use the DPML Magic build system,
          but it can also be done manually or with other tools. The above
          would need a simple descriptor like this;
        </p>
<source>

#
# Specification classifier.
#
dpml.plugin.meta.namespace = net.dpml
dpml.plugin.meta.version = 1.0

#
# Artifact descriptor.
#
dpml.artifact.group = mycompany/thisproject
dpml.artifact.name = hello-impl
dpml.artifact.version = 1.4.1
dpml.artifact.signature = 20050116.140842

#
# Type.
#
dpml.plugin.class = com.mycompany.thisproject.HelloImpl

#
# API dependency.
#
dpml.artifact.dependency.api.0 = artifact:jar:mycompany/thisproject/hello-api#1.4.1

#
# SPI dependencies.
#
# No SPI dependencies
# dpml.artifact.dependency.spi.0 =

#
# Implementation dependencies.
#
# No impl dependencies
# dpml.artifact.dependency.0 =
</source>
        <p>
          Now, the beauty of Transit is that IF the hello-api artifact is present
          in the parent classloader (or higher), the API classloader will NOT
          receive an additional instance of the Jar. This means that, if
          the plugin user have the hello-api already loaded it is not added to the
          API classloader, and the correct classloader management is ensured.
          Furthermore, if any of the Classloaders in the chain
          becomes empty, i.e. no new URLs not present in the parent structure,
          then the Classloader in question is not created.
