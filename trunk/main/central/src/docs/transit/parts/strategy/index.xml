        Transit provides two strategy definitions - <a href="plugin.html"><tt>plugin</tt></a> 
        and <a href="resource.html"><tt>resource</tt></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        The plugin definition is the common form and used to establish plugable services
        within a software system. The resource definition is a special case used to handle
        the declaration of a antlib resource path and namespace - used in conjunction with 
        plugable tasks and datatypes.

      The <tt>&lt;strategy&gt;</tt> element represents an abstract schema type as 
      such the <tt>xsi:type</tt> attribute is required in order to reference a 
      concrete strategy. In the following example the <tt>xsi:type</tt> attribute
      is selecting the <tt>plugin</tt> schema type.

      The above strategy declaration is equivalent to the following:

      The following example demonstrates the use of a foreign strategy definition
      (qualified by a namespace uri):
