    <section name="Host Layouts">

      <p>
        Transit resource hosts configuration allows the declaration
        of a host layout scheme.  Layout schemes deal with the mapping 
        of a resource identifier to a resource location.  Three layout 
        schemes are provides as a part of the core Transit system 
        together with support for the installation of custom layout 
        handlers.  The standard layout schemes supported within the 
        Transit core system are described below. 
      </p>

      <subsection name="Classic">
        <p>
        The ClassicLayout decodes artifacts into the Classic/Maven layout
        of artifacts on a file system or http server. This format says that
        for an artifact <tt>artifact:[type]:[group]/[name]#[version]</tt>
        the location of such artifact would be: <tt>[group]/[type]s/[name]-[version].[type]</tt>.
        Example; <tt>artifact:jar:metro/cache/dpml-cache-main#1.0.0</tt>
        would return the path <tt>metro/cache/jars/dpml-cache-main-1.0.0.jar</tt>.
        </p>
      </subsection>  

      <subsection name="Eclipse">
        <p>
        The EclipseLayout decodes artifacts into the Eclipse specified layout
        of artifacts on a file system or http server. This format says that for 
        an artifact <tt>artifact:[type]:[group]/[name]#[version]</tt>
        the location of such artifact would be: <tt>[group]-[version]/[name].[type]</tt>.
        Example; <tt>artifact:jar:eclipse/plugins/eclipse-osgi-runtime/core#3.1.0</tt>
        would return the path <tt>eclipse/plugins/eclipse-osgi-runtime-3.1.0/core.jar</tt>. 
        </p>
     </subsection>  

      <subsection name="Modern">
        <p>
        The ModernLayout decodes artifacts into a layout scheme that follows the 
        <tt>[group[/[subgroup[/...]]]/[version]/name[-[version]].type</tt> convention.
        Example; <tt>artifact:jar:metro/cache/dpml-cache-main#1.0.0</tt>
        would return the path <tt>metro/cache/1.0.0/dpml-cache-main-1.0.0.jar</tt>.
