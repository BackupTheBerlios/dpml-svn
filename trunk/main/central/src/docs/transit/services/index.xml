        <p>
        Two additional services are provided, one dealing with Transit monitors
        and the other dealing with Plugin services.  Transit <a href="monitors.html">
        monitor support</a> is primarily of interest to developers that wish to 
        integrate transit events into a foreign environment.  
        The Transit <a href="plugins.html">Plugin services</a> is a more general
        service that deals with classloader construction, plugin creation, and 
        object instantion support.
