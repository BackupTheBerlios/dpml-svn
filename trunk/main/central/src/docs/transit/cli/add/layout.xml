        Adds a new custom layout scheme to the Transit configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
        When resolving an <tt>artifact</tt> uri Transit will convert the 
        uri to a url using a layout scheme associated with resource host
        definition.  The layout scheme provides the mapping between the 
        uri identify and a physical location on a remote host file system.
        Transit provides two standard layout - 'classic' and 'eclipse' and 
        a mechanisms to suppliment the configuration with custom layout
        strategies.  Custom layouts are implementated via a Transit plugin
        with a plugin class that implements the <tt>net.dpml.transit.Layout</tt>
        interface.  Once a custom layout is associated with a Transit configuration
        it may be referenced via its <tt>id</tt> within resource host definitions.
