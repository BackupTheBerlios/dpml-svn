  <body>
    <section name="Local Protocol">

      <p>
        The <code>local</code> protocol handler provides support for artifact style 
        references to content under the user's local <code>${dpml.prefs}</code> 
        directory.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Specification">
        <p>
          The specification of the local protocol is as follows;
        </p>
<source> local:[type]:[group]/[name]#[version] </source>
        <p>
        Type and name are required fields. The group and version field is optional.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            type
          </td>
          <td>
            The type of the artifact - e.g. "properties". 
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            group
          </td>
          <td>
            The group to which the artifact belong, so that naming conflicts
            can be avoided.
            It is recommended that the group is multi-leveled and slash
            separated, where the top level denotes the distinguishable name of
            the organization.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            name
          </td>
          <td>
            The name of the resource.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            version
          </td>
          <td>
            Optional opaque identifier.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <subsection name="Using an local URL" >
        <p>
          Using local URLs are no different from any http or ftp URLs. You
          create them by instantiating the <code>java.net.URL</code> class,
          and setting the protocol to "local" (no quotes).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example local URI identifies a resource named
          "standard" associated with the "org/acme" group, using a 
          resource type "properties".
        </p>

        <source>local:properties:org/acme/standard</source>

        <p>
          The above uri is equivalent to the following logical file path:
        </p>

        <pre>${dpml.prefs}/org/acme/properties/standard.properties</pre>
