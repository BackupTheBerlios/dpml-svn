    <section name="Registry Protocol">

      <p>
        The <code>registry</code> protocol handler provides support accessing
        a remote object published within an RMI registry using a URI in the 
        form <tt>registry[:&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]]:&lt;path&gt;</tt>.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Specification">
        <p>
          The specification of the registry protocol is as follows;
        </p>
<source>registry[:&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]]:&lt;path&gt;</source>
      </subsection>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            host
          </td>
          <td>
            The RMI registry host. 
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            port
          </td>
          <td>
            The assigned port.  Defaults to 1099.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            path
          </td>
          <td>
            The name under which the object is published.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <subsection name="Using an registry URL" >
        <p>
          Using registry URLs are no different from any http or ftp URLs. You
          create them by instantiating the <code>java.net.URL</code> class,
          and setting the protocol to "registry" (no quotes).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example registry URI identifies a object named
          "dpml/station".
        </p>

        <pre>registry:dpml/station</pre>

        <p>
        The following code demonstrates the resolution of the object.
        </p>

<source>URI uri = new URI( "registry:dpml/station" );
Station station = (Station) uri.toURL().getContent( new Class[]{Station.class} ); </source>
