      A project is an extension of a resurce defintion. A project definition is typically
      used by a build system implementation to harvest information about dependecies, 
      produced resources, and project specific properties.  Typically a project definition
      if sufficient to establish and deploy a embedeed build system such as the DPML default
      Ant-based builder.

      <p>
      A project differs from a resource in terms of the granularity of detail associated with
      dependency references.  Specifically - a project can delcare RUNTIME dependencies that 
      are scoped in terms of theor rank within a classloader chain.  Dependencies can be scoped
      as PUBLIC, PROTECTED or PRIVATE.  This supplimentary data can be used in the construction 
      of plugin descriptors that separate the classic public API from restricted (or PROPTECTED) 
      management APIS from the resources internal PRIVATE classloader. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Another important distinction between a resource and project is the declaration of a
      base directory.  Typically the base directory of a project is used by a build system 
      to resolve sources and generate build artifacts.  While the project defintion itself is 
      independent of the build strategy, it can provide properties that influence the selection
      of a build system and subsequent build system behaviour.
