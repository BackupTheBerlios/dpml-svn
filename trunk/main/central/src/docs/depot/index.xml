      The project builder provides support for the building of multiple 
      projects taking into account inter-project dependencies, production
      declarations, and build strategy.  The builder makes extensive use
      of a common <a href="../library/index.html">library</a> to establish a build 
      context and identify the build system <a href="tools/index.html">
      implementation</a> to execute.
