      <p>
      One of the objectives of the DPML component development strategy 
      is an effective breakdown of concerns such that you end up with 
      small and easily understandable sub-systems.  However, while 
      individal projects are under control, the configuration management 
      of an overall system (possibly involving several hundred sub-projects)
      becomes an inevitable configuration management concern.
      </p>

      <p>
      Depot addresses overall configuration management through 
      centralization of project information within a 
      <a href="../library/index.html">common build library</a> that 
      captures information about <a href="../library/projects.html">
      projects</a> and shared <a href="../library/resources.html">resources</a>
      organized and structured with distrinct
      <a href="../library/modules.html">modules</a>.
      A <tt><a href="../cli/index.html">build</a></tt> commandline tool provides 
      support for listing of registered projects and support for the execution 
      of project builds.  The build tool executes builds using a plugin builder. 
      A default <a href="../tools/index.html">build system implementation</a> 
      based on the Apache Ant product is included in the Depot distribution.
