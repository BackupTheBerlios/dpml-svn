      <p>
      One of the aims of the Depot build system is the simplification 
      of build procedures. Depot focusses on the principal of 80/20 where
      80% of projects can be easily automated to extent that no 
      build file is needed at all.  For the remaining 20% Depot provides 
      mechanisms to customize builds for those specialized requirements.
      Overall - the aim is to reduce the amount of information that 
      resides in a build file and focus where possible on mechanisms that
      will enable consistent and relaiable build automation.
