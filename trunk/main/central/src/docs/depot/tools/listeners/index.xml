      <p>
      During project initialization the product definition is consulted to 
      determin the resource types that the project produces.  Using the 
      builder configuration, listeners are selected, sorted, and assigned to 
      current ant project to handle type production.

        <p>
        The APIs relating to listener declaration should be considered as 
        non-final.  In effect there is the need for model improvements 
        to support the declaration of listeners that don't produce a specific
        type but instead are involved in the contribution to type production.
        For example - a listener dealing with rmic compilation does not itself 
        produce an build artifact but could contribute to a jar process.  
        Secondly, there may be benefits in defining a more specific listener 
        interface that deals with build phases as opposed to the more generic 
        Ant BuildListener.
