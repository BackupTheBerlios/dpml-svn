      <p>
      The Depot Library <a href="../cli/index.html">CLI handler</a> will 
      resolve a builder plugin using the property <tt>project.builder.uri</tt>.
      The Depot Builder Plugin is an example of a build system based on the 
      Apache Ant product.  The plugin class <tt>net.dpml.tools.impl.StandardBuilder</tt>
      handles the establishment and configuration of a Ant Project using information
      from a <a href="../library/projects.html">project</a> definition. The plugin
      creates a local <a href="context.html">Context</a> object which provides 
      convinient access to project related information such as classpaths, file 
      locations, and project related properties.
      </p>

      <p>
      From a technical perspective the project definition provides sufficent information 
      for the creation and parameterization of the Ant project such that a build can 
      be exectuted without a build.xml file. The builder achieves this through the 
      assignment of a project base directory and a template build file.  Templates are 
      resolved using the <tt>project.template</tt> property which defaults to the value 
      of the <tt>project.standard.template</tt> property.  If neither property is defined, 
      the default template <tt>local:template:dpml/tools/standard</tt> will be assigned.
