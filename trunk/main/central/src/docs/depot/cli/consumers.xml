        The <tt>-consumers</tt> switch inverts the selection to be 
        all projects that are consumers of the selected project. The 
	  <tt>-consumers</tt> (or <tt>-c</tt>) switch may be applied
        in both build and list modes.

      <subsection name="Limitations">

        <p>
        The implementation does not currently support the 
        generation of consumers from a multi-project slection.  
        In other words, the active selection must be a single project.
