      <p>
      System properties recognized by Transit include the following:
      </p>
    
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>dpml.transit.profile</td>
          <td>
            Transit will attempt to establish a TransitModel using an XML based
            configuration profile.  The default profile is resolved using the URL
            <tt>local:xml:dpml/transit/standard</tt>. This uri can be overridden 
            using the <tt>dpml.transit.profile</tt> system property
            enabling the selection of a remote profile.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
