        <p>
          An <strong><i>Artifact</i></strong> is a versioned resource that is
          available for use from one or more <strong><i>Resource Hosts</i>
          </strong>.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Artifact Protocol">
        <p>
          A Transit defined protocol that expresses the content, without the
          location, and letting Transit resolve the location according to its
          setup. The <strong><i>Artifact Protocol</i></strong> has the format
          of;
        </p>
<source>
  artifact:[type]:[group]/[name]#[version]!/[ref]
</source>
        <p>
          where;
          <pre><code>
            type    = The type of the artifact, such as jar, png, dtd.
            group   = The group that the artifact belongs to. Groups are
                      stacked with slashes, such as dpml/transit/main.
            name    = The name of the artifact, such as magic-core.
            version = The version of the artifact.
            ref     = A reference within the artifact itself. Used to locate
                      resources within jar/zip artifacts.
          </code></pre>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Link Protocol">
        <p>
          The <strong><i>Link Protocol</i></strong> is a URL protocol to link
          application names to artifact resources. Links points to another
          URI, typically an <strong><i>Artifact</i></strong>, and getting
          the InputStream of the Link will return the InputStream of the target
          URI's InputStream (if resolvable).
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Resource Host">
        <p>
          A <strong><i>Resource Host</i></strong> is a networked computer that
          is serving <strong><i>Artifacts</i></strong> to Transit applications.
