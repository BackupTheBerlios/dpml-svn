    <section name="Resource Host - Classic Layout">
      <p>
        The Classic resource host management model is based on the
        conventions popularized by the Maven build system and subsequently used
        within the Apache Software Foundation as a format for repository
        layout.  The Classic layout can be viewed as a super-set of the
        Maven model in that Transit implementation fully supports unlimited
        group segmentation.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Resolution">
        <p>
          The official format for the artifact protocol is as follows;
        </p>
<source> artifact:[type]:[group]/[name]#version </source>
        <p>
          which for Classic resource hosts will be translated into;
        </p>
<source> [resource-host-base-url]/[group]/[type]s/[name]-[version].[type] </source>
        <p>
          where,
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>
              The type of the resource.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>group</td>
            <td>
              The group the resource belongs to. Slashes in the group are
              allowed and denotes subgrouping.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>name</td>
            <td>
              The name of the resource.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>version</td>
            <td>
              The version of the resource. The version is an opaque string
              in the current Classic resource host implementation, but may
              evolve in the future, and known version formats should be used
              for maximum future compatibility.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
         with the exception that if the [version] is an empty string the
         dash will not be part of the resolved URL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore. for this resource host type there are currently some
          semantic meaning built in to the Version, if it is "SNAPSHOT" (no
          quotes), which we may remove in the near future.
