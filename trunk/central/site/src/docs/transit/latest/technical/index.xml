    <section name="Transit Protocol Specifications">

        <p>
        The section contains the formal specification of the Transit system protocols.
        This includes the the <a href="artifact.html">artifact</a> protocol 
        (a uri that can be used to construct a url which in turn can be used to resolve 
        a remote resource to a local cache), the <a href="link.html">link</a> protocol 
        enabling logical uri references to physical uris, and the <a href="local.html">local</a> 
        protocol supporting structured access to application preferences.
