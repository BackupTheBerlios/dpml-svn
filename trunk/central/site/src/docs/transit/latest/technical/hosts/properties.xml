      <p>
        If a host.xml file is not present, Transit will atempt to resolve hosts using
        a set of property based host descriptors.  Property files describing remote hosts 
        are based on the following property specification.

            artifact to the remote host. SCP will be used, and username and 
            password will be used from the above property settings.
