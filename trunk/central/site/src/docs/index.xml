          <a href="transit/latest/index.html">Transit</a> is a framework for managing 
          system artifacts and application resources. As a resource 
          management system, Transit provides the foundation for building 
          repository-enabled applications enabling automated classloading 
          construction and dynamic plugin management.

          <a href="magic/latest/index.html">Magic</a> is an intelligent build system for Java 
          based component development. Magic provides support for a centralized project 
          object model, transitive version and dependency management, and a suite of  
          tools that automate the processes of building well-structured component 
          solutions.

          <a href="metro/latest/index.html">Metro</a> is a light weight container 
          that provides comprehensive support for the management of composite components.
          Metro simplifies component management through automated 
          assembly and deployment combined with strong support for the isolation of 
          implementations from the service that a component provides. Metro applications 
          and services are implemented through component composition enabling a building 
          blocks approach that delivers very high reuse and unprecedented runtime 
          flexibility.

          <a href="depot/latest/index.html">Depot</a> is an application that provides 
          support for (a) application deployment services, and (b) configuration management  
          for humans. Depot requirements are focused on the management concerns driven 
          by Metro including remote management of Transit and automated deployment of 
          Metro based server applications.
