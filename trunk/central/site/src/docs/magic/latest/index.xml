      <p>Magic is an advanced build system for Java based component development.
        It provides support for a centralized project object model, version and 
        dependency management, and a suite of tools that automate the processes
        of building well-structured component solutions.  Each project within 
        the magic object model declares build, test and runtime dependencies.  
        These dependencies are transitive in that dependencies of one project
        are implied as dependencies of a dependent project.  This information 
        enables automated build sequencing and high levels of automation with 
        respect to the generation of runtime meta-data.
