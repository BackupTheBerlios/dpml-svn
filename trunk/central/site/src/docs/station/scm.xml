    <section name="Station SCM">

      <p>
      The Station Service Control Manager (SCM) provides support for 
      the establishment of the Station as a NT system service with automatic
      deployment on machine startup.  Once installed and started multiple
      applications can be managed using the Station <a href="cli/index.html">
      CLI</a> console.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Installing the SCM">

        <p>
        The following command will install the DPML Station as an NT Service
        under the service name <tt>dpml</tt> (or just go to the share\bin\scm
        directory and double click on the install-DPML-SCM.exe file).
        </p> 
<pre>
$ %DPML_HOME%\share\bin\scm\install-DPML-SCM
</pre>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Starting and Stopping the Service">

<pre>
$ net start dpml
</pre>

<pre>
$ net stop dpml
</pre>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Removing the SCM">

        <p>
        The following command will uninstall the DPML Station NT Service.
        </p> 
<pre>
$ %DPML_HOME%\share\bin\scm\uninstall-DPML-SCM
</pre>

      </subsection>

    <section name="Techical Note">

      <p>
      When using the Station as an NT Service it is recommended that 
      you refrain from using the station <tt>startup</tt> and <tt>shutdown</tt>
      commands.  If effect the NT service automates the startup of the server
      duirng the OS boot sequence and shutdown is handled duirng OS shutdown.
      Invoking a shutdown via <tt>$ station shutdown</tt> will result in the 
      termination of the service process.  If the <tt>$ station startup</tt>
      is invoked manually, an attempt to start the NT service will fail due
      a port conflict.
