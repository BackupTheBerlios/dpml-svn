        The dpml-logging package is a open logging platform suitable for 
        use by container implementators. It leverages the dpml-transit 
        repository technology to support dynamic loading of implementation 
        strategies. It simplies the overall approach to target configuration,
        and applies a formal logging category meta-data model that is 
        consitent with the DPML model-driven product strategy.
