      <subsection name="Description">
<p>
  An include directive instructs Metro to load and deploy the block defined 
  within the referenced jar file as a subcontainer within the enclosing 
  container.  The include directive is equivalent to the nesting of a full 
  block definition within another block.  Block includes enable composition of 
  pre-packaged component based solutions as the included block appears to other
  components as a regular component (exposing services and dependecies, etc.).

            <td>
             A set of target directives scoped relative to the container established 
             by the include. Each target declaration corresponds to the specification of 
             <a href="../../../overrides/targets/index.html">target override target element</a> 
             presented under the config.xml spec.

      <subsection name="Sample XML">
<p>
The following example block.xml demonstrates the inclusion of three blocks within another enclosing block.  In this example, the common shared API (containing service interfaces classes is declared in the containing block classloader).
