      <p>
        Two types of testing scenarios are provided in the Metro Unit
        package. In the <a href="simple.html">simple testing</a> scenario
        you instantiate the lifecycle artifacts manually and the component
        is tested without running inside Metro. In the <a
        href="integration.html">integration testing</a> scenario, your
        test case subclasses the MetroTestCase, which will start a Metro
        instance and deploy the component in it.
