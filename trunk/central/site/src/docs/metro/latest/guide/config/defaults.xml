      <subsection name="Creating a Default Configuration">
        <p>
        Metro provides support for the association of a default
        with a component type.  This is achieved by including a 
        &lt;classname&gt;.xconfig resource co-located with the 
        component class.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources supporting this tutorial are contained in the 
        tutorials/configuration/defaults/ directory.
        </p>

        <p>
        Build and run the tutorial again.
        </p>
        <source>
$ ant
$ metro -execute target\classes
</source>
        <p>
        In the logging output we see that the default configuration
        supplied to the component has been generated by the 
        information we supplied inside the xconfig resource.

        The <a href="block.html">next tutorial</a> shows how Metro 
        provides support for the packaging of configurations within 
        the block.xml deployment directive with a component.
