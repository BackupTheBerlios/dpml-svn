    <section name="Runtime Policies">
    
      <p>
      Metro component runtime behaviour is governed by three policies.  These 
      policies deal with <a href="activation.html">activation</a> behaviour, the 
      component <a href="lifestyle.html">lifestyle</a> (controlling
      decisions as to when a new instance of a component is required), and garbage 
      <a href="collection.html">collection</a> policies (controlling the strength 
      of internal references between a component model and its instances).
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Runtime policies may be declared via class 
      <a href="../annotation/index.html">annotations</a> or through related 
      attributes in packaged <a href="../profile/index.html">profiles</a> 
      or <a href="../directive/index.html">component directives</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Runtime policies are summarasied under the following table.
      </p>
      
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="activation.html">Activation</a></td>
          <td>
            Enables declaration of activation on STARTUP or activation
            on DEMAND policy.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="lifestyle.html">Lifestyle</a></td>
          <td>
            Used to declare the strategy to be applied by a container when
            a request for access to a component is received. The policy 
            provides for the selection of either a SINGLETON scope within
            which requests are shared across multiple consumers and thread
            boundaries, THREAD in which a component instance is created for 
            based on thread identity, and TRANSIENT under which a new component
            instance is created per request.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="collection.html">Collection</a></td>
          <td>
            Declaration of a garbage collection policy controlling the 
            strength of internal references between a component model and its 
            instances.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
