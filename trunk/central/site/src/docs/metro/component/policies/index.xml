      <p>
      Metro component runtime behaviour is governed by three policies.  These 
      policies deal with <a href="activation.html">activation</a> behaviour, the 
      component <a href="lifestyle.html">lifestyle</a> (controlling
      decisions as to when a new instance of a component is required), and garbage 
      <a href="collection.html">collection</a> policies (controlling the strength 
      of internal references between a component model and its instances).
      Runtime policies may be declared via class 
      <a href="../annotation/index.html">annotations</a> or through related 
      attributes in packaged <a href="../profile/index.html">profiles</a> 
      or <a href="../directive/index.html">component directives</a>.
