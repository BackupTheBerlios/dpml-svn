        Peter has been a founding member of DPML and, together with Niclas Hedhman and Stepen McConnell,
        been involved in the initial discussion of the OPS (Open Participation Software) community model that is practiced at DPML.

      <p>
      Born in Eastern Germany, moved to Sweden 1998. Currently working at ScanCoin
      with software for banking automation. Joined the DPML community in 2004 after
      using Merlin for production environment with very good success.

      and DPML especially. Trying to formulate the arguments of why industrial companies (i.e. 
      non-IT companies) should invest money in OSS projects instead of paying 
      consultants, and in the process create a good value proposition and sustainable 
      business model for OSS projects.
      </p>
       <p>
       Trying to apply Agile Development and TDD to OSS. Using Metro as a tool to achieve
       minimizing of the in-house code base and thus decreased maintanence, time to market and 
       better refactoring support in corporate development scenarios.
