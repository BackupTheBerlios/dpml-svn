        The Digital Product Meta Library is a global community project contributing to 
        the development of advanced Java-based component management solutions.
        The initial community was formed from a core group of Apache developers 
        focussed on the next generation of component management solutions 
        (a.k.a <a href="history.html">beyond Avalon</a>).
        The community established itself with general principals of 
        "low barrier to entry", the "flock of bird" principal concerning evolution, and 
        a high priority on commerical friendliness. Development during 2005 witnessed a
        a movement towards a greater product-driven focus and the <a href="people/index.html">
        core community</a> is currently focussed on our first release and the parrallel 
        development of the the operational and administrative 
        <a href="process/index.html">processes</a> aimed towards the growth and development 
        of a self-sustaining community.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of our aims is the creation of a non-profit organization,
        which we anticipate to get incorporated in Q1-2006. This will allow
        us to engage in more formal activities, establish better infrastructure, 
        marketing materials and much more.
