        <p>
        The primary object of the Depot Station is to provide a 
        solution for local application deployment and an access 
        point for remote management and monitoring.
        </p>

        <p>
        Not a lot of discussion has taken place on this yet, although
        some ideas have been floated concerning JINI and JMX.  There is
        also the potential of bringing together application profiles and 
        the RMI Activation framework as a means of providing an elegant 
        application deployment solution.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Local Application Deployment">

        <p>
        The current Depot implementation provides some basic support 
        for the deployment of applications based on a application profile 
        name.  Application profiles are maintained under user preferences
        relative to the key /dpml/depot/lang/profiles/[name].  Each 
        profile declare a main class classname, an application title, 
        and two nested preference nodes - one for the classpath and 
        another for system property declarations.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Depot CLI script assigns the DepotClassLoader as the system 
        classloader.  The DepotClassLoader has an unusual feature of 
        providing support for the late-binding of application URLs. This 
        allows us to setup the initial system classloader during JVM setup
        following which Depot populates the classloader based on application 
        profile settings.  The current implementation is working in that
        it is handling the setup of the Depot Preferences application, however
        it has not been tested on anything more rigorous and I'm expected 
        some more evolution to occur - in particular, classpath URL ordering
        is significant when dealing with bootstrap resources (e.g. protocol 
        handlers).
        </p>

        <p>
        Deploying an application using the Depot script is basically 
        the following:
        </p>

<pre>$ depot -profile [name] [your-application-args]</pre>

        <p>
        Where [name] is the name of a preferences node under the tree
        /dpml/depot/lang/profiles/.
        </p>
