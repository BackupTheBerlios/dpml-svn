      <subsection name="Build Procedure">

        <p>
The DPML platform has the four major product groups.
To build respective products please invoke the following commands:
        </p>

<pre>
$ cd main
$ ant transit           ... builds the transit diustribution and updates the local installation
$ ant magic             ... builds the magic build system (requires transit)
$ ant metro             ... builds Metro (requires Magic)
$ ant central           ... builds site documentation (requires Metro)
</pre>

<p>
Please note that the Transit build will install the junit jar file
under the .ant/lib directory if not available.  In such a case the
build will exit with a failed condition and a message requesting
recommencement of the build.  If you run transit target a second
time the build will continue as normal.
</p>

<p>
For a complete build of the whole platform you can use a Utility script. Windows users will execute build.bat and Linux users will execute build.sh. The syntax for the usage is (in this case showing the Usage for Linux, Windows will have to adapt) :
</p>

<pre>
$ cd main
$ ./build.sh all 1234
</pre>

<p>
The first argument determines what will be build. Here 'all' is the keyword to build the whole platform. The above listing is still valid (with all it dependencies), so you can replace 'all' with 'transit' and the script will build only the 'transit'-product.

The second argument is optional and describes a build revision identifier.
