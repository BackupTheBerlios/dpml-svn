        <p>
          If you are installing on a single user system, we recommend the following
          installation. We assume that the binary distribution has been downloaded 
          to your $HOME directory.
        </p>
        <source>
mkdir $HOME/.dpml
cd /$HOME/.dpml
tar xvfz $HOME/dpml-platform-nnnn.tar.gz
chown -R $USER .
        </source>
        <p>
          And enter the following into your own login script, e.g. $HOME/.bashrc.
          $HOME/.bash_profile  (system dependent).
        </p>
        <source>
HOME=$HOME/.dpml
export HOME
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/share/bin
export PATH
        </source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Multi-user Unix/Linux setup">
        <p>
          If you are installing on a multi-user system it is important that the
          permissions are properly set up. We recommend that the following
          commands are executed as root. We assume that the binary 
          distribution has been downloaded to the /root directory, and that the
          system has a group named "users" which all users belong to.
        </p>
        <source>
mkdir /usr/share/dpml
cd /usr/share/dpml
tar xvfz /root/dpml-platform-nnnn.tar.gz
chown -R root.users cache
chmod -R g+w cache
cd cache
        </source>
        <p>
          And the following setup to be entered into the shared user login script,
          e.g. /etc/profile (system dependent).
        </p>
        <source>
HOME=/var/dpml
export HOME
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/share/bin
export PATH
        </source>
