      <p>
      A framework for modularization of project structures enables the 
      establishment and maintenance of discrete namespaces.  In turn this
      improves the overall maintainability within large-scale projects.  
      The Depot system maintains information about project and resources 
      within <a href="../library/modules.html">modules</a> and provides
      support for the production of a module suitable for export and use 
      by external projects. This adds to the general integrity concerning 
      naming, content versioning, and overall dependency management.
