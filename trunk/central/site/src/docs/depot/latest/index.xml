      <p>
      Depot is an application that provides support for (a) application 
      deployment services, and (b) preferences management for humans. 
      Depot requirements are focused on the management concerns related 
      to the <a href="/metro/index.html">Metro</a> component soluton.  
      Initially this scope is closely related to <a href="/transit/index.html">
      Transit</a> configuration via <a href="prefs/index.html">Depot Preferences</a> but is 
      intended to grow to include remotely accessible preference 
      management and ultimately runtime management for Metro based 
      applications via <a href="console.html">Depot Console</a> and 
      <a href="station.html">Depot Station</a>.
