      <p>
        For those of you who are on a more mission critical path, where time
        is of essence, some of the core developers have agreed to make 
        themselves available for expedient support services at reasonable
        subscription fees. These developers are the actual people who
        develop the DPML products like Magic, Transit and Metro.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the engagement is between you and the developer.
        The Digital Product Meta Library is not part of the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The QoS Level provided by the developer is subject to his/her own
        conditions, and the standard templates below are attempts to let the
        developers standardize around mutually acceptable agreements.
        If the developer follows the templates, the template name is quoted
        in the fee table above. If the developer has other terms, he/she
        will provide a link to those terms in the table above.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Supreme QoS" >
        <p>
          This level allows the subscriber to engage the developer at any
          point in time, and that the developer will attend to the issue
          within an hour. The developer will work on a resolution at 
          best-effort and to the greatest extent possible without risking
          health. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If the developer knows that he/she will not be able to comply, 
          he/she will contact the subscriber at least 24 hours in advance to
          notify of such non-availability and the reason why (for instance, 
          travelling, meeting, illness). By default and unless otherwise 
          negotiated, the developer is entitled to 2 such instances per 
          month, after which 50% of the Stand-by fee will be reimbursed.
          If the non-availability exceed 5 days, the entire stand-by fee
          will be reimbursed.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Basic QoS" >
        <p>
          This level limits the subscriber to engage the developer during
          the developer's working hours. and that the developer will attend
          to the issue within 4 working hours. The developer will work on a
          resolution at best-effort, but may limit such effort to 8 hours 
          per day.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the developer knows that he/she will not be available, he/she
          will contact the subscriber as soon as possible at best-effort,
          stating reason and for how long. If the non-availability extends
          more than 2 working days, the stand-by fee will be reimbursed
          proportional to the non-availability.

          The fees are set by the individual developer, and the variations are
          due to a number of factors, such as; geographical location, 
          experience, demand and personal preferences. Fees are typically not
          negotiable, unlike the <a href="consultancy.html">consultancy
