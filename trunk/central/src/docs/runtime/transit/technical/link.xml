    <section name="Link Protocol">

      <p>
        The <code>link</code> protocol handler provides support for artifact style 
        references to a resource which contains a reference to another uri.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Specification">
        <p>
          The specification of the link protocol is as follows;
        </p>
<source> link:[type]:[group]/[name]#[version] </source>
        <p>
        Type, group and name are required fields. The version field is optional.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            type
          </td>
          <td>
            The type of the artifact - e.g. "module". 
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            group
          </td>
          <td>
            The group to which the artifact belong, so that naming conflicts
            can be avoided.
            It is recommended that the group is multi-leveled and slash
            separated, where the top level denotes the distinguishable name of
            the organization.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            name
          </td>
          <td>
            The name of the resource.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            version
          </td>
          <td>
            Optional opaque identifier.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <subsection name="Using an link URL" >
        <p>
          Using link URLs are no different from any http or ftp URLs. You
          create them by instantiating the <code>java.net.URL</code> class,
          and setting the protocol to "link" (no quotes).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example link URI identifies a resource named
          "dpml-metro" associated with the "dpml/metro" group, using a 
          resource type called "module".
        </p>

        <source>link:module:dpml/metro/dpml-metro</source>

        <p>
          The above uri refers to a special artifact datatype with same name
          as a normal artifact plus the ".link" suffix.  The contents of this 
          data object is a text file continaing a redirection uri.  Resolving 
          the content of a link will result is the delgation of the request 
          to the uri declared by the link.
