        David joined DPML in 2004 just as it was being spun out of the Apache Avalon
        Project. He initially investigated component management tools as part of
        his development in the area of bioinformatics. Very impressed with the
        vision, diligence, and incredible user support provided by the community,
        it was clear that from the start that he wanted to be a part of its activities.

        Born and raised in Victoria, B.C., Canada, David lived for 2 years in France, then
        about 10 years in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he obtained his Bachelor's degree
        in electrical engineering from the Universit&#233; de Sherbrooke. Soon after, he
        found his way to Japan where he is now married and the owner of both a Japanese-based
        bioinformatics company as well as a Montreal-based software company.

        One of David's main interests is to import the knowledge available at DPML
        into Japan. Along with some of his Japanese partners, he is working on training
        materials and consulting services for advanced Java component management.
