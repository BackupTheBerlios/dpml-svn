      <subsection name="An example component ....">

      <p>
      Here is an example of a component.
      </p>
<source>
package net.dpml.composition.testing;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class ExampleComponent implements MyService
{
    private final logger m_logger;

    public ExampleComponent( Logger logger, Context context )
    {
        m_logger = logger;
        m_context = context;
    }
    
    public void doMyStuff()
    {
        Dimension dimension = m_context.getDimension();
        int w = dimension.getWidth();
        m_logger.info( "Creating a widget with a width of " + w + "." );
    }

    public interface Context
    {
        Dimension getDimension();
    }
}
</source>

      <p>
      The first notable divergence from classic Metro is the usage
      of <code>java.util.logging.Logger</code>.  The rational here is 
      that with the decision to use JDK 1.4 as a base line, the value
      of another logger class is questionable - in particular, the usage
      of java.util.logging eliminates a framework dependency.  
      </p>

      <p>
      The second point of divergence is the usage of the Context inner 
      interface in preference to javadoc tag markup.  In this case we have 
      the declaration by the component that it needs an instance of <code>Dimension</code>.
      From the Metro point of view this is equivalent to a non-optional 
      dependency of the type <code>Dimension</code> assigned to the key
      <code>dimension</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Another important point in FT is that there is no distinction from the 
      component implementation point-of-view between context and dependencies
      thus eliminating the need for <code>net.dpml.context.Context</code> and the 
      <code>net.dpml.service.ServiceManager</code> framework interfaces.  When
      combined with the usage of <code>java.util.logging.Logger</code> we are 
      starting to see the emergence of a sustainable framework independent 
      component strategy.  
      </p>

      <p>
      From a formal point-of-view Context operations are expressed using patterns.  
      Allowable method patterns within the Context inner interface are listed 
      below:
      </p>

<pre>
[type] get[key]();               // required entry
[type] get[key]( [default] );    // optional entry
</pre>

      <p>
      Declaration of an optional context entry would look like the 
      following:
      </p>

<source>
public class ExampleComponent implements MyService
{
    public interface Context
    {
        Dimension getDimension( Dimension value );
    }

    ...

    public void doMyStuff()
    {
        Dimesion defaultValue = new DimensionValue( 10, 20 );
        Dimension dimension = m_context.getDimension( defaultValue );
        ...
    }
}
</source>

      <p>
      One concern of the inner-interface approach is the potential level of 
      verbosity this creates.  This issue can be handled easily by referencing 
      standard context interfaces.  For example, the following one line context 
      inner interface demonstrates the definition of the context via extension  
      of a another context interface.
      </p>

<source>
public interface DimensionalContext
{
    int getHeight( int h );
    int getWidth( int w );
}

public class ExampleComponent implements MyService
{
    ...

    public interface Context extends DimensionalContext
    {
    }
}
</source>

      <p>
      Constraints applied to context entry method declarations include
      the following:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>no exception declarations</li>
        <li>return type may not be void</li>
        <li>return type may not be an array (this may be relaxed in the future)</li>
        <li>zero or one method parameter where the supplied parameter is the default</li>
        <li>a default parameter type must be assignable from the return type</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      An Ant task has been created that generates a serialized Type for each component.  
      Unlike the classic javadoc tag based approach, the task uses information 
      available in Magic to construct the runtime implementation classloader and 
      uses this to load the component class.  Using introspection the information 
      about the component is extracted, validated, and stored in a .type 
      serialized Type holder.  This process enables substantial validation of the 
      declaration within inner-interfaces and in particular, the integrity of method
      declarations, return types, and parameter declarations.
      </p>

      <p>
      Build time constraints applied during the Context evaluation include:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>context dependencies shall be declared within an inner interface 
            named <code>Context</code></li>
        <li>context return types and parameters will be checked for 
            accessibility within the runtime implementation classloader established by
            the Magic build system</li>
        <li>type assignability between default parameters and return types will 
            be checked</li>
      </ol>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Creating the component part ...">

      <p>
      A component part is somewhat similar to the notion of a block in classic
      Metro, however under FT a number of significant differences are present.  
      Firstly, a part is stored as a serialized description (a .part file) thereby 
      eliminating the time consuming XML definition loading, parsing and construction 
      of deployment directives.  Instead - we load a part and we have the complete 
      directive ready to work with.  Secondly - with the removal of the notion of 
      container the definition of a part is a definition of the component deployment 
      scenario.</p>

      <p>
      The following fragment of a build file demonstrates the generation of the 
      component type information and the subsequent usage of that information in 
      the generation of the component part for the component we have described above.
      </p>

<source><![CDATA[
  <target name="build" depends="standard.build">

    <types xmlns="plugin:dpml/composition/dpml-composition-builder">
      <type class="net.dpml.composition.testing.ExampleComponent"/>
    </types>

    <component dest="example.part" 
        xmlns="plugin:dpml/composition/dpml-composition-builder" 
        type="net.dpml.composition.testing.ExampleComponent"
        name="demo">
      <context>
        <value key="dimension" class="net.dpml.composition.testing.DimensionValue">
          <param class="int" value="2"/>
          <param class="int" value="5"/>
        </value>
      </context>
    </component>

  </target>
]]></source>

      <p>
      The above example starts of with the creation of the <code>&lt;types&gt;</code>.
      The output of each <code>&lt;type/&gt;</code> element is the serialized type
      descriptor collocated with the class (i.e. basically the same as the .xinfo but
      in a serialized form and names [classname].type).
      </p>

      <p>
      Following type creation we move on with the creation of a <code>&lt;component&gt;</code>
      part. The <code>&lt;component&gt;</code> element <code>dest</code> attribute tells the task where 
      to store the serialized descriptor (and if not supplied the output defaults to a classic 
      deliverables artifact filename).  The <code>type</code> attribute is the reference to the 
      component type we want to use. The <code>&lt;context&gt;</code> element contains all of 
      the information describing the fulfillment of the components dependencies.  In the above
      examples this is limited to the supply of an instance of Dimension.  The solution employed
      above is to create a simple constructed object using the DimensionValue class by declaring the 
      classes constructor parameters as nested &lt;param&gt; elements.
      </p>

      <p>
      It is important to note that the strategy concerning the creation of the Dimension
      is totally customizable.  You could for example create your own custom part builder and  
      declare this inside the <code>&lt;context&gt;</code> element.  
      </p>

      <p>
      A second and equally important aspect of the above is that we have removed any notion
      from the component as to how the dependency is resolved (compared to classic Metro where
      dependencies were distinct from context entries).  To demonstrate this point, we could
      replace the above <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> with an alternative solution using a 
      component strategy.
      </p>

<source><![CDATA[
    <component dest="example.part" 
        xmlns="plugin:dpml/composition/dpml-composition-builder" 
        type="net.dpml.composition.testing.ExampleComponent"
        name="demo">
      <context>
        <component key="dimension" type="net.dpml.composition.testing.DimensionComponent"/>
      </context>
    </component>
]]></source>

      <p>
      In the above examples we have demonstrated alternative approaches to 
      the population of a context.  In both cases we have a developer in control
      (in that it is a developer that is writing the component XML). In effect 
      this is demonstrating "developer" as the point of authority concerning the 
      establishment of the context values.  But what if we want our application 
      to take control?  This is where parts and parts management come into play.
      </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Parts of a component ...">

      <p>
      In classic Metro we use the composition api as the framework for dynamic 
      management.  In Metro FT this is replaced by a <code>Parts</code> inner interface
      and another set of method patterns supporting instance management, deployment and
      release.
      </p>

      <p>
      The following source code is from the class ExampleContainer.  It is 
      basically the same as ExampleComponent except that we have included the 
      Dimension as a part.  As a part the Dimension context is accessible to 
      the containing component (ExampleContainer) and we can get in there are 
      do things based on current state.
      </p>

<source>
package net.dpml.composition.testing;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class ExampleContainer implements Example
{
    private final Logger m_logger;
    private final Context m_context;
    private final Parts m_parts;

    public ExampleContainer( final Logger logger, final Context context, final Parts parts )
    {
        m_logger = logger;
        m_context = context;
        m_parts = parts;
    }

    public void doMyStuff()
    {
        //
        // configure the dimension component's context map
        //

        Map map = m_parts.getDimensionContextMap();
        int width = m_context.getWidth( 9 );
        int height = m_context.getHeight( 7 );
        map.put( "height", new Integer( height ) );
        map.put( "width", new Integer( width ) );

        //
        // get the dimension instance
        //

        Dimension dimension = m_parts.getDimension();
        int size = dimension.getSize();
        m_logger.info( 
          "Creating a widget with a area of " + size );
    }


    public interface Context extends DimensionalContext{}

    public interface Parts
    {
        Map getDimensionContextMap();
        Dimension getDimension();
    }
}
</source>

      <p>
      The parts of component are distinct from context in that 
      parts are exclusivly managed by the containing component.  In the above
      example the Dimension component model is declared in XML and the 
      component is reaching into the context model of the Dimension component
      and modifying height and width values based on it's own context information.
      After modification of the context the component acquires an instance of 
      Dimension and proceeds with service execution.
      </p>

      <p>
      The formal patterns associated with a Parts inner interface deal with 
      default and identifiable instances.
      </p>

      <p>
      Methods dealing with the default instance include:
      </p>

<pre>
   [type] get[key]();                     // return the default service instance
[manager] get[key]ContextManager();       // return the context manager for the default instance
      Map get[key]ContextMap();           // return the context map for the default instance
Component get[key]Component()             // return a model of a Component instance
    Model get[key]Model()                 // return the Model of a component type
</pre>

      <p>
      Methods dealing with the identifiable instance include:
      </p>

<pre>
   [type] get[key]( [id] );               // return an identified service instance
   [type] get[key]( [id], [policy] );     // same as above with control over proxy creation
[manager] get[key]ContextManager( [id] ); // return the context manager for the identified instance
      Map get[key]ContextMap( [id] );     // return the context map for the identified instance
Component get[key]Component( [id] )       // return a model of an identified Component instance
    Model get[key]Model( [id] )           // return the Model of an identified component type
</pre>

      <p>
      In addition to the above the following optional release method signature 
      is supported:
      </p>

<pre>
     void release[key]( [instance] )         // release of a proxy or implementation instance
</pre>

      <p>
      In the above examples we are interacting with the context model of the 
      Dimension component via the <code>java.util.Map</code> interface.  As suggested 
      by the <code>[manager] get[key]ContextManager( [id] );</code> a type safe
      management strategy is also provided as demonstrated in the following code 
      fragment:
      </p>

<source>
    public void doMyStuff()
    {
        DimensionalContext.Manager manager = 
          m_parts.getDimensionContextManager();
        manager.setHeight( height );
        manager.setWidth( width );

        Dimension dimension = m_parts.getDimension();
        int size = dimension.getSize();
        m_logger.info( 
          "Creating a widget with a area of " + size );
    }

    public interface Parts
    {
        DimensionalContext.Manager getDimensionContextManager();
        Dimension getDimension();
    }
</source>

     <p>
     Where DimensionContext and the associated inner Manager are defined as:
     </p>

<source>
public interface DimensionalContext
{
    int getHeight( int h );
    int getWidth( int w );

    interface Manager extends DimensionalContext
    {
        void setWidth( int width );
        void setHeight( int height );
    }
}
</source>

     <p>
     In effect the Parts interface and its associated patterns provide
     a framework for management of internal parts with minimal API 
     intrusion (significantly reducing the OS risk factor).
     </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Parts within parts ...">

     <p>
     The following part descriptor demonstrates the creation of a part 
     containing another part within itself.  Nested parts are declared within
     the <code>&lt;parts&gt;</code> element.  Support for custom part handlers
     is provided at the build level, allowing for example the inclusion of a 
     completely foreign part as a intrinsic part of the containing part.  This 
     feature will enable 'radical' development of the metro platform while 
     retaining runtime compatibility with prior releases.
     </p>

     <p>The part descriptor:</p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Parts by reference ...">

     <p>
     In addition to the classic declaration of parts - support has been included
     for parts-by-reference.  The following <code>&lt;component&gt;</code> delcaration 
     has a <code>&lt;parts&gt;</code> element that is using the <code>&lt;part&gt;</code>
     element to include a foreign part by reference to a Transit artifact uri.
