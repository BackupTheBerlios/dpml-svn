Guys,

Thank you for riding this storm at ASF, but Stephen and myself have evaluated 
the options and balanced that against the inofficial feedback from Stefano.
There is not going to a Metro TLP. Period.
There _might_ be, with a low probability, an incubation without Steve.
I am not interested, nor is Steve.

Instead, I am proposing a _radical_ way. It is up to you guys if you want to 
to be part of it or not, but I and Steve are steaming along the path set out 
below.

We move to our own server. Not SourceForge. Our own. And now comes the really 
funky part. 
I don't want to do Open Source Software !  It is too restrictive, too much 
bureaucracy and a legal overhead not worth it.

WHAT?

It struck me yesterday, that OSS may have gotten it all wrong, but for a 
reason.
OSS stands for "Open the SOURCE for everyone". That doesn't mean anything more 
than the source code is available to everyone. Depending on license there are 
various restrictions and opportunities.
What is important to notice is that, although _I_ typically can do anything to 
the source code for _myself_, it barely means that _I_ can take part in the 
process of evolving it further.
Exactly WHY there is ranks in OSS is unfathomable to me. It looks more like a 
military organization than anything else, and over at Linux side, they even 
use such titles. You work hard, you earn your ranks. Then you don't need to 
work so hard anymore, and can promote those under you. Once promoted, being 
demoted is a huge process.
Therefor, before anyone "gets in" they must Earn themselves WORTHY.
So, an organization like ASF builds a Trust Model based basically on 
"Everybody Trusts Everybody", and that's why we can see ASF Members ganging 
together like wolf packs, irregardless of the issues they back up fellow 
members blindly.

Instead I want to do OPEN PARTICIPATION Software.

You will of course again go, WHAT?

The closest metaphor for OPS (or whatever better name we can come up with) is 
a "Flock of Birds". None of the Birds decides the direction, possibly not 
even knowing exactly where they are going, yet they fly together, and 
probably instincts drives them for there needs.
Any bird that leaves the flock is more likely to be killed by a predator, than 
those sticking together.

So? 

Peter Neubauer expressed the OPS principle extremely well;
User: "Hey guys, I have this patch that ... "
Community: "Cool. Why don't you commit it yourself?"

Take things to the extreme. Let everyone who wants take part, PARTicipation in 
the evolution of a codebase.

First reaction seems to be; "It won't work!"
Think of it is as "Wiki brought to Coding."
Whatever argument one can come up with in this area, has already been iterated 
about Wiki. But obviously Wiki works. Why does it work? Because everyone 
WANTS it to work.

Another concern that Stephen brought early was that the one about "oversight", 
"overall direction", "quality management" and "release management".
Direction == where the flock wants to go. (mind you, 5 people is not a flock. 
50 is a flock.)
Quality == Everyone wants high quality. Again enough people want it, it will 
happen.
Release == People who are interested in this will manage it.
Oversight == There will be a lot more eyes overseeing everything.

Another term we need to get used to is the "Collective Decision Making 
Process". Everybody who is active  *at the moment*, not 3 years ago, not last 
year, not last month, NOW, are the ones who decide. If you are not actively 
involved one way or the other, you should volunteerily not partake in the 
decisions, and trust that those who does is doing the right thing.
If you didn't like it, fork it and prove them wrong, gather a flock and see if 
anyone wants to fly with you. If noone come along, better get back to the 
flock before the predator kills the lonely bird. Can it be that simple, or do 
we need "Social Networking Patterns" beyond this? I don't at the moment.

Licensing?
What does the ASL actually say?
"This software can be used as-is or modified in anyway you see fit, without 
any warranties."
That is the main advantage of ASL over the dictatorship-like GPL.
And there is a BIG BUT.
"But you may NOT REMOVE THIS Copyright."

That is a MARK. I could say a malicious intent to put your mark on that code 
for all times to come. But in an organization like ASF, this imposes some 
consequences.

First of all, the License is a *legal* document.
Secondly, that *legal* document is tied to the Copyright.
Thirdly, ASF owns the Copyright, so ASF must EXIST as a *legal* entity.
Fourthly, ASF doesn't write the code. External people (call committers) write 
it, so they need a *legal* agreement, called CLA from the committers.
Fifthly, ASF is now owner of an asset that can be *legally* challenged in 
court, and need to minimize the *legal* exposure.

I read a lot of *LEGAL* up there, And what was the purpose of all of that 
again?
To put your MARK on the code, that people can do anything with.

Doesn't that sound a bit out of propotion? It does to me.

The solution is extremely simple and been around as a legal concept in many 
countries for centuries. It is called Public Domain. The Scientific community 
uses it effectively. Research result is publish, and then automatically part 
of the Public Domain.

Public Domain for code would mean that "We have produced this code. Use it 
anyway you like." Period. Not buts, no strings, no reservations.
That means we don't need all of the above legal mumbo-jumbo. No licenses, no 
copyright assignments, no organization, no cost overhead.

We put up an infrastructure that basically is a subversion server, where 
people can register themselves to get access to the repositories. That 
registration process, has a click-through saying;
"I hereby acknowledge that everything I commit to this system belongs in the 
Public Domain." (or something along that line).
What the system then needs to do is to tie the semi-anonymous (not sure if 
this is allowed) registration to each commit.
If ever there would be a legal challenge, it would be the "plaintif"'s 
headache to find who that individual is and sue for damages. Once it is 
declared Public Domain, it is not a reversible process (could vary from 
country to country). It stays in Public Domain.

Furthermore, all the development is going to be classified as Research to 
further minimize the legal exposure in more restrictive jurisdiction, as most 
are lenient on Research.
That means, we don't produce a binary product. Only source code. Binaries are 
either built by the end user (my pref, and used by Cocoon already) or handled 
by whoever is interested outside, for instance on a SF.net project.

This could further challenge the existing OSS system, especially the GPL.

import net.sf.hibernate.Session;
import net.sf.hibernate.Transaction;

Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();

Have I now violated the (L)GPL of Hibernate?
It is the GPLed code in a text file.
I would say not, and the idea of only keeping source in the system, and 
resolving the building, linking and running at the client, I can't possibly 
see how one is violating their license. More research in this area probably 
required, but I think it looks bleak for the GPL.


OK, so my proposal to you guys are;

 *  Public Domain for all result.
 *  Open Participation Software where anyone can join in without barrier.

I want this group to be the Founders of OPS.

Initially we are not a flock, but I think that we change very rapidly, since 
we can pull a fair number of users with us from Avalon, giving us an 
upper-hand compared to starting from scratch.

I think we can start a new movement, and I am sure we will have various 
"problems" that needs solutions along the way. We are somewhat exploring new 
territory and need to be fairly adaptive to what may come our way.

&lt;snip content="quote not allowed to be reproduced" /&gt;

I say the same thing; What is the big deal about ASF? An organization that 
will be outdated in no time with our new ideas. Stiff, bureaucratic and 
political to its very core, where secrecy is a tool of control.

Ok, now what?

Stefano has also promised, publicly and to me personally, that he will do what 
he can to release the Merlin codebase from the ASL and place it into the 
Public Domain. He thinks that is fair towards Stephen and the rest of us.
If anyone doesn't want their part of the code to be treated this way, better 
speak up now.
There is of course the chance that the Board says NO to that.
In that case, each person need to either do himself, or better authorize 
me/Steve to release their piece of code into the Pubilc Domain. You all still 
own Copyright to your own work, jointly with ASF.
That leaves a handful of patches from other people, and we hope to get their 
authorization as well, otherwise we need to strip that out. Painful process, 
so just hope we can provide proper encouragement to the Board to do us the 
favour.

I have arranged and paid for a server in Denmark for us to use for 12 months 
we probably need better hosting facilities thereafter.
I have put up subversion running there. We will run the website on top of 
subversion, so no need to have any shell account access for that reason, and 
the site automatically becomes versioned and any version always available 
online.
There is a simple backup solution in place, which Zips up the Svn repo and 
copies it to another computer daily.
We will be able to put up more services later, and deal with that when it 
comes. We need a registration process for commit rights, suggestions in this 
area is welcomed.
I suggest we establish mailing-lists elsewhere, but I have no experience of 
what is available, but sure must exist. 
So if the mailing list can be solved, I and Steve can cook together a "New 
Home" by early next week. Enough to host users who will popping by after the 
announcement is made on users@avalon.apache.org
We need to forward the exact list of the source codebase that we want to be 
release into the Public Domain. I suggest Steve establishes that list, he 
knows best.


Ok, guys! Let's change the World !!

Cheers
Niclas / Stephen
