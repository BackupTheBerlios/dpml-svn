        <p>
        A state is an immutable datastructure that defines a collection 
        of available transitions, management operations, and possibly
        initialization or termination triggers.  Actionable features
        of a state are exposed when the state is within the current state path.
        The current state path is a path composed of the current state, it's 
        parent, parent's patrent, etc. unit the root state is reached.  As 
        such, any operations declared within the root state will always be 
        available where operations and/transitions in sub-states will only
        available if the associated state is present in the state path.
