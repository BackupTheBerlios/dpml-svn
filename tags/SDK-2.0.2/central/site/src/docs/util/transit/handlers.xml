    <title>DPML Transit Content Handler Framework</title>
  </properties> 

  <body>
  
    <section name="Content Handlers">

      <p>
      The Transit framework provides dynamic support for artifact
      content type handlers.  The content type refers to the <tt>type</tt> 
      field of an artifact uri.  For example - the following uri declares
      an artifact with a type equal to "<tt>appliance</tt>".
      </p>
      
      <source>artifact:appliance:osm/http/osm-http-express#1.0.0</source>
      
      <p>
      When a client application resolves the content from an artifact
      URL, the Transit system attempts to locate a content handler supporting
      the content type of the artifact.  Content handlers are located by
      resolving all services implementing the <tt>net.dpml.transit.ContentHandler</tt>
      interface, using <tt>java.util.ServiceLoader</tt>.  Examples of content 
      handlers included within the DPML suite include the following:
      </p>
      
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>part</td>
          <td>An XML datastructure used to describe a classloader chain and
          object deployment strategy.  The part datatype is used extensively
          by the DPML Metro component management platform.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>appliance</td>
          <td>An XML datastructure used to describe an application deployment
          scenario - containing infomation for the configuration of a Java
          vertual machine.  The appliance datatype is used extensively by the 
          DPML Station application server.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
