
Part/PartDecoder

  1. Part encoding is currently inside Part - needs to be moved to a separate PartEncoder class.
  2. PartDecoder includes functionlity concerning the caching of Part instances - this logic
     should be moved inside the Part class (or into a separate ContentHandler)
  3. Part.instantiate should be expanded to check for a Services annotation and return a 
     proxied instance if the class asserts one or more services.\ (and equivalent functionality
     in metro should be retracted)
  4. Value encoder and decoder does not support uri recognition of alternative value types so 
     its not currently possibly to add new value expressions (e.g. nested context directives).
  5. Instantiation strategies are currently handled via specializations of the Part class.
     This could be improved by moving the strategy to a separate abstract Strategy class 
     the Plugin, Resource and Component reference as a base.
