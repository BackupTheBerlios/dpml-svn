      <p>
      Metro provides five optional annotations supporting:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>association of runtime policy to a class</li>
        <li>association of additional meta data</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
      These annotations are summarasied under the following table.
      </p>
      
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="activation.html">Activation</a></td>
          <td>Used to associate an explicit activation policy 
              with the class.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="component.html">Component</a></td>
          <td>Used to declare a default component name, lifestyle policy, 
              collection policy, an explicit lifecycle graph, 
              and/or alternative runtime handler uri or classname.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="context.html">Context</a></td>
          <td>Annotation used to mark an interface as compliant 
              with the Metro Context contract (in effect a bean 
              like instance built and populated by the container 
              delivering the component dependencies).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="parts.html">Parts</a></td>
          <td>Annotation used to mark an interface as compliant 
              with the Metro Parts contract (though which the internal 
              structure of a component may be established).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="services.html">Services</a></td>
          <td>Annotation used to to declare the service classes that a
