      <p>
      During the deployment of the runtime system the runtime needs
      to determin if it is directing a deployment scenario of if deployment
      will be demand driven by some external client.  This concerning is 
      described via the activation policy.

        <tr>
          <td><tt>STARTUP</tt></td>
          <td>
          The <tt>STARTUP</tt> activation policy dictates that a 
          component instance shall be activated during the startup 
          sequence of the containing component (or controller in 
          case of a root component).

        <tr>
          <td><tt>DEMAND</tt></td>
          <td>
          The <tt>DEMAND</tt> activation policy dictates that a new 
          runtime instance of a component will not be created until 
          such time that an actual service request is raised (sometimes
          referred to as lazy activation).

      <subsection name="Default Policy">

        <p>
          A special activation policy named <tt>SYSTEM</tt> is used
          to delegate the selection of a activation policy to the 
          container. If no explicit activation policy is nominated
          by a component the <tt>SYSTEM</tt> policy will be asserted.
          The default behaviour of the runtime is to assign the 
          <tt>STARTUP</tt> activation policy to top-level components and 
          the <tt>DEMAND</tt> policy to subsidiary instances.
