        <p>
        The station commandline handler provides support for the startup and shutdown of 
        a collection of background applications runing under dedicated virtual machines.  
        In a production environment the station is normally setup as a background service 
        (e.g. on Windows resources are provided for the deployment of the Station as an 
        NT service).  Applications handled by the station are declared under a station 
        <a href="../plan/index.html">deployment plan</a>.
