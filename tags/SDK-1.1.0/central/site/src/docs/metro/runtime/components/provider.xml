      <p>
      A <tt>Component</tt> is responsible for the management of a set 
      of service <tt>Provider</tt>(s).  The number of providers
      managed by a component is implementation dependent.  The reference
      implementation maintains providers relative to the associated 
      <a href="../parts/lifestyle.html">lifestyle</a> and 
      <a href="../parts/collection.html">collection</a> policies. For 
      example, a component declaring the <tt>SINGLETON</tt> collection 
      policy will have a 0..1 <tt>Provider</tt> association.  The lifetime
      of the provider will be a function of the associated collection 
      policy and usage contitions.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <tt>Provider</tt> exposes the following functions:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>access to the concrete service instance with support
            for isolution of the instance within a proxy exposing 
            only the service interfaces</li>
        <li>access to the provider <a href="state.html">state</a>
            and as a consequence the available mangement transitions and 
            dynamic operations</li>
      </ol>

        <p>
        The following snipet of code demonstrates the creation of a 
        service provider using a part uri and the subsequent resolution
        of the provider instance.
        </p>

        <pre>
Controller controller = Controller.STANDARD;
URI uri = new URI( "artifact:part:acme/acme-widget#1.1" );
Component component = controller.createComponent( uri );
<font color="darkred">Provider provider = component.getProvider();</font>
Widget widget = (Widget) provider.getValue( true );
