
To build the DPML suite - please following the following procedure:

  a) define the DPML_HOME environment variable 
  b) build the bootstrap resources
  c) build the main DPML system

A. Setup Environment
--------------------

Declare an environment variable DPML_HOME referencing the location you want 
for the system installation (for example C:\system\dpml) and add 
%DPML_HOME%\share\bin to you PATH definition.

B. Bootstrap Build
------------------

Create a directory to hold the svn codebase (e.g. c:\dev\dpml\main), checkout 
the sources, cd to the main directory and invoke the bootstrap build procedure.

  $ cd dev\dpml\main
  $ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/dpml/trunk/main
  $ bootstrap

C. Main System Build
--------------------

The bootstrap procedure will create a number of executables under 
%DPML_HOME%/share/bin.  To successfull invoke the build command the bin 
directory must be included in your PATH environment variable.

  $ cd dev\dpml
  $ build

The build procedure will build approximately 40 projects during which a number 
of downloads may occur.  On completion the %DPML_HOME% should be fully populated and 
operational.
