        <p>
        The Transit antlib provides a set of low-level tasks that deliver the bootstrap 
        functionality needed to load dynamic extensions.  The Transit antlib includes an 
        import, get, and plugin tasks. The plugin task is used to load antlibs, 
        taskdefs, typedefs and build listeners using classloaders established relative 
        from Transit plugin descriptors.  The import task provides support for the inclusion 
        of local or remote build templates.  The get task provides support for the retrieval 
        of remote resources using artifact references and the mapping of cached files to 
        project properties.
