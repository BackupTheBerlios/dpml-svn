      <p>
      All runtime instances associated with a component are maintained 
      under reference objects.  The reference object that is selected 
      by the runtime is determined by the component collection policy.
      The following table lists available collection policies and 
      related semantics.

          <td>The <tt>HARD</tt> ensures that an instance reference will 
          be maintained for the life of the runtime unless explicitly 
          destroyed as a result of container shutdown or management request.
          The <tt>HARD</tt> collection policy should not be used in 
          conjunction with <tt>TRANSIENT</tt> lifestyle.

        <p>
          A special collection policy named <tt>SYSTEM</tt> is used
          to delegate the selection of a collection policy to the 
          container. If no explicit collection policy is nominated
          by a component the <tt>SYSTEM</tt> policy will be asserted.
          The default behaviour of the runtime is to assign the 
          <tt>HARD</tt> collection policy to top-level components and 
          the <tt>SOFT</tt> policy to subsidiary instances.
