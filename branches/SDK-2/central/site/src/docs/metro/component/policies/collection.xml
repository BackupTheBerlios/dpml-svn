      <p>
      All runtime instances associated with a component are maintained 
      under reference objects.  The reference object that is selected 
      by the runtime is determined by the component collection policy.
      The following table lists available collection policies and 
      related semantics.
      </p>

          <td>The default <tt>HARD</tt> policy ensures that an instance reference will 
          be maintained for the life of the enclosing component model unless explicitly 
          destroyed as a result of container shutdown or management request.
          The <tt>HARD</tt> collection policy should not be used in 
          conjunction with <tt>TRANSIENT</tt> lifestyle.

           and memory contention occurs, component instances held under
           the <tt>SOFT</tt> collection will be garbage collected.</td>

      <p>
      Unless an alternative collection policy is declared as an annotation or as 
      a feature of a packaged profile, or a feature of a strategy declaration, 
      the <tt>HARD</tt> collection policy is assumed.
