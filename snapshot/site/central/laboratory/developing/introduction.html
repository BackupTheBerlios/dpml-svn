  <p>
    In the beginning was Apache JServ.  Stefano Mazzocchi and others
    helping develop Apache JServ realized that several patterns used
    in that project were generic enough to create a Server Framework.
    On Wednesday January 27, 1999 (roughly a month after release 1.0b
    of JServ) Stefano put together a proposal to start a project
    called the Java Apache Server Framework.  It was to be the basis
    for all Java server code at Apache.  The idea was to provide a
    framework to put together components and reuse code across a
    number of projects.
  </p>
   </div>
  <p>
    Stefano Mazzocchi, Federico Barbieri, and Pierpaolo Fumagalli
    created the initial version.  Later in 2000, Berin Loritsch and
    Peter Donald joined the project. By that time, Pierpaolo and
    Stefano had moved on to other projects and Java Apache Server
    Framework started to use the name Avalon. Those five developers
    are the main people responsible for the original design and
    concepts used by the framework.  The current version is very
    similar to the version that was released in June 2000.  In fact,
    the major difference is the reorganization of the packages, and
    splitting the project into subprojects.  The same design patterns
    and interfaces exist today.
  </p>
  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">What is Avalon?</span>
    <p>
      Avalon is a parent project for three sub-projects: Framework,
      Merlin, and Cornerstone. Another two projects are currently
      being developed in the Avalon Sandbox, worth mentioning is
      the Eclipse plugin called MerlinDeveloper and the 
      AvalonNet which is a Microsoft dotNet implementation of 
      Avalon. Avalon also carries a lot of legacy, which was deprecated
      in 2004, namely 
      <a class="doclink" href="http://excalibur.apache.org">Excalibur</a>,
      <a class="doclink" href="http://loom.codehaus.org">Phoenix now known as Loom</a> and 
      <a class="doclink" href="http://excalibur.apache.org/fortress">Fortress</a>.
      These containers and utilities has been deprecated and no longer
      being actively worked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people think of the Framework when they hear the name Avalon,
      but it is more than that.  Avalon began as the Java Apache
      Server Framework that had the framework, utilities, components,
      and a server's kernel implementation all in one project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since all the pieces of Avalon are of different maturity levels,
      and have different release cycles, we have decided to break
      Avalon into the smaller projects mentioned above.  That move also
      enables new developers to understand and learn Avalon in distinct
      chunks -- something that was almost impossible before.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Avalon Framework</span>
      <p>
        Avalon Framework is the basis for all the other projects under
        the Avalon umbrella.  It defines the interfaces, contracts, and
        default implementations for certain Avalon.  The Framework has the most
        work put into it, and consequently is the most mature project.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Avalon Merlin</span>
      <p>
        Avalon Merlin is "The Avalon Container", the reference container where
        all contracts, framework interfaces, and other specifications are
        fully supported. Merlin is often also a testing ground of new ideas
        prior to promoting them to Avalon Framework.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Avalon Components</span>
      <p>
        Avalon Components is a collection of services that you
        can deploy in Avalon compliant containers, such as the reference 
        container Merlin. Avalon Components is starting in March 2004,
        and will gradually import the former Avalon Cornerstone components,
        and make and keep them compliant with the current Avalon Framework.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Avalon Sandbox</span>
      <p>
        Avalon Sandbox is not really an official project, but it is the
        staging area for software package that are not ready for inclusion in
        the other projects yet.  They are of varying quality, and their APIs are
        not guaranteed to remain consistent until they are promoted.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Focus for this Overview</span>
    <p>
      We are focusing on Avalon Framework in this overview, but we will
      cover enough of Avalon Merlin to get you
      started.  We will use a hypothetical business server to demonstrate
      how to practically use Avalon.  It is beyond the scope of this
      overview to define a full-blown methodology, or to cover every
      aspect of all the sub projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      We decided to focus on Avalon Framework because it is the basis
      for all of the other projects.  If you can comprehend the framework,
      you can comprehend any Avalon-based system.  You will also become
      familiar with some of the programming idioms common in Avalon.
      Another reason for focusing on the framework and touching on the
      Avalon Merlin project is that they are officially released and 
      supported.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">What Can Avalon Be Used For?</span>
    <p>
      We have been asked on a couple of occasions to identify what Avalon
      is good for, and what it is not good for.  Avalon's focus is server
      side programming and easing the maintainability and design of server
      focused projects.  Avalon can be described as a component oriented
      programming specification (Avalon Framework) and a robust reference
      implementation (Avalon Merlin).
    </p>
    <p>
      While Avalon is focused on server side solutions, many people have
      found it to be useful for regular applications.  The concepts used in
      Framework and Merlin are general enough to be used for
      any project.
    </p>

    <p>
      The word <em>framework</em> is broad in software application.
      Frameworks that focus on a single software industry like medical 
      systems or communications are called vertical market frameworks.  
      The reason being that the same framework will not work well in 
      other industries.  Frameworks that are generic enough to be used 
      across multiple industries are known as horizontal market frameworks.
      Avalon is a horizontal market framework.  You would be able to
      build vertical market frameworks using Avalon's Framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most compelling example of a vertical market framework built
      with Avalon is the publishing framework Apache Cocoon. Apache
      Cocoon version 2 is built using Avalon's Framework, Excalibur 
      (obsolete - replaced by Avalon Merlin), and LogKit (obsolete - 
      replaced by Avalon Logging) projects.  It makes use of the 
      interfaces and contracts in the Framework to reduce the time it 
      takes for a developer to learn how Cocoon works.  It also leverages 
      the data source management and component management code in 
      Excalibur so that it does not have to reinvent the wheel.  Lastly, 
      it uses the LogKit to handle all the logging in the publishing 
      framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you understand the principles behind Avalon Framework, you will
      be able to comprehend any system built on Avalon.  Once you can
      comprehend the system, you will be able to catch bugs more quickly
      that are due to the misuse of the framework. And finally, you will be
      able to re-use your (and other's) well-tested, robust components
      over and over again.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">There is no Magic Formula</span>
      <p>
        It is important to state that trying to use any tool as a magic
        formula for success is begging for trouble.  Avalon is no exception
        to this rule.  Even though Avalon Framework was designed to work for
        server solutions, it is equally at home when using it to build
        Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you need to consider if Avalon is right for your project,
        you can still learn from the principles and design that went into
        it.  The question you need to ask yourself is, "Where is this
        project going to be used?"  If the answer is that it will be run
        in a server environment, then Avalon is a good choice whether you
        are creating a Java Servlet, or creating a special purpose server.
        If the answer is it will be run on a client's machine with no
        interaction with a server, you should evaluate if there is a strong
        component based model running under the hood. If so, it is likely
        that it can be considered to be a server in its own right, and that
        the GUI sitting on top is a window into the real application, which
        would make Avalon perfect. In either case, you should 
        probably investigate Eclipse and NetBeans as GUI frameworks to 
        build on top of.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Principles and Patterns</span>
    <p>
      All of Avalon is built with specific design principles.  The two 
      most important patterns are <em>Inversion of Control</em> and
      <em>Separation of Concerns</em>.
      Component Oriented Programming, Aspect Oriented Programming, and 
      Service Oriented Programming also influence Avalon.  Volumes could 
      be written about each of the programming principles, however they 
      are design mindsets.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Inversion of Control</span>
      <p>
        Inversion of Control (IOC) is the concept that a Component is
        always externally managed.  This phrase was originally coined
        by Brian Foote in one of his papers ( <a class="doclink" href="http://www.laputan.org/drc/drc.html">http://www.laputan.org/drc/drc.html</a>
        ) Everything a Component needs in the way of Contexts,
        Configurations, and Loggers is given to the Component.  In
        fact, every stage in the life of a Component is controlled by
        the code that created that Component.  When you use this
        pattern, you implement a secure method of Component
        interaction in your system.
      </p>
      <table>
       <tr row="odd"><th>Warning!</th></tr>
       <tr row="even"><td>
      IOC is not equivalent to security!  IOC provides a mechanism
      whereby you can implement a scalable security model.  In order
      for a system to be truly secured, each Component must be secure,
      no Component can modify the contents of objects that are passed
      to them, and every interaction has to be with known entities.
      Security is a major topic, and IOC is a tool in the programmer's
      arsenal to achieve that goal.
      </td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Separation of Concerns</span>
      <p>
        The idea that you should view your problem space from different
        concern areas resulted in the Separation of Concerns (SOC) pattern (
            <a class="doclink" href="http://www.research.ibm.com/hyperspace/MDSOC.htm">
              http://www.research.ibm.com/hyperspace/MDSOC.htm
            </a>).
        An example would be viewing a web server from different viewpoints
        of the same problem space.  A web server must be secure, stable,
        manageable, configurable, and comply with the HTTP specifications.
        Each of those attributes is a separate concern area.  Some of these
        concerns are related to other concerns such as security and
        stability (if a server is not stable it can't be secure).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Separation of Concerns pattern in turn led to Aspect Oriented
        Programming (AOP) (
        <a class="doclink" href="http://eclipse.org/aspectj/">http://eclipse.org/aspectj/</a>).
        Researchers discovered that many concerns
        couldn't be addressed at class or even method granularity.  Those
        concerns are called aspects.  Examples of aspects include managing
        the lifecycle of objects, logging, handling exceptions and cleaning
        up resources.  With the absence of a widely accepted and stable AOP 
        implementation, the Avalon team chose to implement Aspects or 
        concerns by providing small interfaces that a Component implements.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Component Oriented Programming</span>
      <p>
        Component Oriented Programming (COP) is the idea of breaking a
        system down into components.  Each
        facility has a work interface and contracts surrounding that
        interface.  This approach allows easy replacement of Component
        instances without affecting code in other parts of the systems.
        The major distinction between Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
        and COP is the level of integration.  The complexity of a COP
        system is more easily managed due to fewer interdependencies
        among classes, promoting the level of code reuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the chief benefits of COP is the ability to modify portions
        of your project's code without breaking the entire system.  Another
        benefit is the ability to have multiple implementations of the
        Component that you can select at runtime.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Service Oriented Programming</span>
      <p>
        Service Oriented Programming (SOP) is the idea of breaking a
        system down into services provided by the system.

        Avalon Merlin is very Service oriented, and not only can a
        component provide a Service, but an aggregation of components
        can expose Services to be re-used.
        It is important to realize that a server is made up of multiple 
        Services.  To take the example of a mail server, there are the 
        protocol handling services, the authentication and authorization 
        services, the administration service, and the core mail handling 
        service. And it is possible to expose a single simple Service 
        from the mail server, which can be used by others, without knowing 
        the details of how to assemble a complete mail server, and not to
        be confused by all the details, a simple include is all that is 
        needed.

        Avalon Components provides a number of low-level services
        that you can leverage for your own systems.  The services
        provided are connection management, socket management,
        principal/role management, and scheduling.  We touch on
        services here because it is relevant to the process of
        decomposing our hypothetical system down into the different
        facilities. Avalon Components are being imported from the
        obsolete Avalon Cornerstone, and in the process bringing the
        components up-to-date with the latest specifications, as well
        as creation of unittests and documentation. This process may
        take a while to complete, and is starting in March 2004.
