    Maybe you are already convinced, but need some help convincing
    your colleagues that Avalon is right for you.  Maybe you need
    some convincing yourself.  Either way, this chapter will help
    wrap everything up, and provide you with some convincing arguments.
    We all need to fight Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) with the
    Open Source model.  For arguments on the validity of Open Source,
    I will direct you to Eric S. Raymond's excellent treaties on the subject.
    Regardless of your opinions on his politics, the
    papers he wrote and compiled into the book 
    <a class="doclink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">
    The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a> will give you the information you need to
    be convinced about the open source model as a whole.

  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Avalon Works</span>
    <p>
      The bottom line is that Avalon accomplishes the goal it was
      originally designed to fulfill.  Avalon does not introduce new
      concepts and ideas, but rather uses and formalizes several concepts
      that have stood the test of time.  The newest concept that influenced
      the design of Avalon is the Separation of Concerns pattern introduced
      sometime around 1995.  Even then, Separation of Concerns is a
      formalization of System Analysis techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avalon's user base is measured in the hundreds.  Several projects
      like Apache Cocoon, Apache JAMES, and Jesktop are all built on Avalon.
      Developers for those projects are users of Avalon Framework.  Because of
      the number of users Avalon has, it is very well tested.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Designed by the Best Minds</span>3
      <p>
        The authors of Avalon recognize that we are not the sole experts
        on server side programming.  We use concepts and ideas from other
        people's research.  We respond to feedback from our users.  Avalon
        is not just designed by the five developers mentioned in the
        introduction -- the people who came up with the concepts of Inversion
        of Control, Separation of Concerns, and Component Oriented
        Programming designed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beauty of Open Source projects is that the result is an
        amalgamation of the best ideas and the best code.  Avalon has gone
        through periods of testing ideas and rejecting them because there
        was a better solution.  You can take the knowledge gained by the
        Avalon team and use it in your own systems.  You can take the
        predefined components in Excalibur and use them in your own
        projects -- they have been tested to work under heavy load without
        errors.

    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Compatible License</span>
      <p>
        The <em>Apache Software License</em> (ASL) is compatible
        with just about every other license known.  The biggest known
        exceptions are the <em>GNU Public License</em> (GPL)
        and the <em>Lesser GNU Public License</em> (LGPL).  The
        important thing is that the ASL is friendly to corporate development,
        and does not force you to release your source code if you don't want
        to.  It is the same license used for the Apache Software Foundation's
        venerable HTTP server.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Pooled Research</span>
      <p>
        Most of Avalon's users contribute back to the project in some way.
        This spreads the cost of developing, debugging, and documenting the
        framework across several users.  It also means that Avalon's code
        has gone through a more extensive peer review than would ever be
        possible in one company.  In addition, users of Avalon support
        Avalon.  While it is true open source projects do not typically have
        a help desk or telephone support line, we do have a mailing list.
        Many times your questions can be answered in less time on the list
        than it would take on some support lines.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Simplified Analysis and Design</span>
      <p>
        Developing on Avalon helps the developer to get into a mindset.
        That mindset focuses the efforts on how to identify Services, followed
        by an implementation of such service, a component.  Since many of the
        details regarding the life of the components and Services in the 
        system are already analyzed and designed, the developer only has to
        choose which ones they need.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to state that Avalon development does not replace
        traditional Object Oriented Analysis and Design, but enhances it.
        You are still using the same techniques you did before, only now
        you have a tool set you can use to achieve your design faster.

  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Avalon is Ready</span>
    <p>
      Avalon Framework, Avalon Merlin, Avalon Repository and Avalon Logging
      are ready for you to use now.  They are mature, powerful products and
      they are only getting better, by the day!
