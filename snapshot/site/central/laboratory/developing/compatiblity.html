  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Compatibility with Avalon Project Containers</span>
  <p>
    There are many applications, utility or tools written in Java that you
    wish you could use in an Avalon container.  It may be that you are
    writing such an app/utility/tool that you intend to additionally be
    usable by Avalon components in Avalon containers.  This document
    gives some advice on the subject.  We will refer to applications,
    utilities and tools as just 'tools' from her on in.  We'll assume
    the classes for which are in a single Jar.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Making a Jar for a tool</span>
    <p>
      The tool's Jar should only contain the classes in question and
      directly associated resources. It should not contain the classes
      or resources from other projects.  For example it is a bad habit
      to include the org.apache.xerces.* jars in another jar.  It would
      be correct for the notes accompanying the tools to list xerces.jar
      as a dependency.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is best that packages for the tool are well defined.  Sun
      recommend a package structure that honors the internet domain of
      the hosted proejct.  For example org.apache prefixes all the packages
      of projects hosted at Apache.  Sometimes a project thinks it is
      significant enough to avoid the domain name based naming, but still
      have a package.  JUnit is an example of this, as it uses junit as its
      top level package.  Tools that have no package or a package name
      that a non unique word are not good design.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Wrapping third party tools</span>
    <p>
      There are many tools written in Java as beans that you wish you could
      use in an Avalon container as a component.  If they are not
      dependent on Avalon packages and classes already it is likely that
      some wrapper concept is appropriate.  The normal form is to have
      a separate package with a class that is dependent on Avalon Framework
      methods.  That wrapper class would be Configurable, Initializable etc,
      and would map its configuration to setZYZ() methods in the original bean.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also a good idea to understand the
      <a class="doclink" href="../../about/cop/guide-patterns-soii.html">
      separation of interface and implementation</a> when designing components.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Dynamic Classloading</span>
    <p>
      Many Java tools internally use
      <em>Class.forName(String).newInstance()</em>
      to instantiate some part of its internal functionality.  This
      works if the class's Jar is mounted at the top-level system
      classloader.  In the case of many Avalon containers, the Jar in
      question will actually be mounted in a classloader at some other point
      in a tree of classloaders.  Thus <em>Class.forName()</em>
      will fail with ClassNotFoundException if running in a container.
    </p>
    <p>
      A better thing to do would be to use
      <em>this.getClass().getClassLoader().loadClass(String)</em>.
      This means that the class will always be loaded from classloader
      that hosts the rest of the classes for the tool.  It can run at any
      point in a tree of classloaders without problem.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><span class="section-header">Use of Static</span>
    <p>
      It is common amongst novice developers to use much static
      functionality.  This could be methods or class variables.  Given
      that Avalon's containers may mount multiple instances of a component
      potentially in multiple classloaders, the use of static may lead to
      unpredicted behavior.  If the static var or method is mounted in a
      classloader that is visible to multiple components, then it will
      behave as expected.  For this reason, static should be used with care
      - you cannot guarantee where someone might try to run your tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Static also makes Unit Testing quite difficult.  If you can at all
      avoid it, please do so.
