The Apache Java LDAP Server (a.k.a. Eve, f.k.a. LDAPd) is the flagship server 
under the new Apache Directory Project.  Eve is a pure Java implementation of 
an LDAP version 3 server based on Avalon and SEDA.  Eve, as the first of its 
kind, will revolutionize the way directories are used by enabling server 
embedding and rich database constructs like stored procedures and triggers.  
Eve leverages JNDI as the embedding API and allows the use of a server side 
JNDI LDAP provider to efficiently access server databases within stored 
procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
Eve's simplicity and modularity, thanks primarily to Avalon design patterns, 
makes it an ideal protocol experimentation and extention framework.  Those 
forging the future of internet directory protocols on standards bodies like 
ldap-bis and others can use Eve to test and demonstrate the substance of new 
RFCs.  Eve's swapable protocol components and plugable backends puts the focus 
on the protocol rather than code management and porting.

            <td><p>Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around 
            the concepts of separation of concerns and component-based web 
            development.
            Cocoon implements these concepts around the notion of 'component 
            pipelines', each component on the pipeline specializing on a 
            particular operation. This makes it possible to use a Lego(tm)-like 
            approach in building web solutions, hooking together components 
            into pipelines without any required programming.
            Cocoon is "web glue for your web application development needs". It 
            is a glue that keeps concerns separate and allows parallel evolution
            of all aspects of a web application, improving development pace and 
            reducing the chance of conflicts.

            <td><p>FtpServer is a server component for Avalon that allows remote 
            FTP client to attach and download files. The client software can be 
            any type of FTP client written in any language. The criteria for 
            eligibility is RFC compliance. The server uses several components. 
            Some of the components have multiple implementations. For example 
            user management has implementations that will use LDAP, JDBC and 
            Cornerstone's Store facility for storage. 
            The server has a management console (GUI) that can connect over RMI 
            to the server.

            <td><p>Fulcrum was originally created as part of the Turbine 3 effort.
The idea was to be able to decouple the services from Turbine 2 allowing
them to be used on both projects. Fulcrum is currently evolving into a
generic component repository useful in building web applications. Each
service is been converted into a stand alone component that can be released
independently of the other components.

<p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure 
Java SMTP and POP3 Mail server and NNTP News server.  James was designed to be 
a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution based on currently 
available open protocols. </p>
<p>James is also a <i>mail application platform</i>.  The James team have 
developed a Java API to let you write Java code to process emails that we 
call the mailet API.  A <i>mailet</i> can generate an automatic reply, update a 
database, prevent spam, build a message archive, or whatever you can imagine.  
A <i>matcher</i> determines whether your mailet should process an email in the 
server.  The James project hosts the Mailet API, and James provides an 
implementation of this mail application platform API.</p>
