        Open Source Software (OSS) in various shapes and forms, is all about
        "Open the Source Code to Everyone". We want to bring the OSS concept
        to the next level.

      <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Invite Everyone</span>
        <p>
          Organizations like Apache Software Foundation, claims to have a Bazar
          of activities where everyone is jolly happy and having fun, creating
          code and programs to the better of human kind. The result of these
          activities, we all know, are genuinely good. Noone can question that.
          But is it necessarily the best process to go about it?
          We think we have identified a problem in the ASF model, and hope to
          show that there are other ways, and we are willing to lead the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          At ASF, it is fun! <strong>if</strong> you are on the 
          <strong>INSIDE</strong>. To get inside is not all
          that easy, but once inside you will remain. Pretty much forever, 
          unless you resign. What does that mean? I struggle like hell, to show
          I am worthy and get the approval of the others on the inside, that I
          should be part of the fun. Once inside, I can relax, be opinion maker,
          make decisions, and contribute to the codebase at my leisure, if at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think there is something basically wrong with this model. It is not
          an <strong>Open Participation</strong> model. Those who are actively
          working on the code, docs, PR materials, participating in the daily 
          chores of the community and have an updated perspective of the 
          issues at hand, should be part of the decision process. Furthermore,
          if I have spent the time to create a patch, I AM committed, no doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>-</strong> <em>"Hi! I have created this patch that ..."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>-</strong> <em>"Jolly Good, ol' chap. Why don't you commit it 
          into the codebase yourself?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          That means, take away the concept of commit rights. You want to join,
          <strong>join!</strong>. Be my guest. We are looking at the principle of 
          Wiki applied to the code scenario. If Wiki works, why wouldn't this?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Open Participation Software</span>
        <p>
          Wiki and the <strong>Open Participation Software</strong> (OPS) builds
          on the metaphor of "A Flock of Birds".
        </p>
        <p>
          No individual bird in the flock sets the direction of the flock.
          They <strong>all</strong> sets the direction of the flock, driven by
          instincts of the moment in each individual. Any bird leaving the 
          flock, is no longer a <em>PartOf</em> the flock and the collective 
          decision process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brought on to our scene, it means that everyone that is 
          <strong>currently</strong> part of the community, adds to the
          collective decision making. If I am on vacation and not staying in
          touch with daily issues, I am not part of the flock. When I come
          back from my vacation, I rejoin as a single small part of the
          collective mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could this possibly work? Could one make a code repository open
          to everyone who has an interest? Wouldn't everything just deteriorate
          rapidly into a 'nothing'?
        </p>
        <p>
          Interesting questions, and the same questions were raised against
          the Wiki concept. It has, IMO, proved the dooms-sayers wrong. It 
          works, because everyone <strong>wants</strong> it to work. Everyone
          benefits, everyone enjoys the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what about licensing? You can't license the code without being
          the owner, and for that you need Copyright assigns,
          indemnification agreements, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          Do we really need a License (BSD, Apache style) that basically says
          "Do whatever you want with this code, as long as you don't remove
          the Copyrights and don't use our name(s) to promote your derived 
          work." ?  IMHO, this is a matter of <em>Pride</em>. If I am
          <strong>truly</strong> "Open", can't I just say; "Here is a bit of
          code, do what you like with it."? Why do I need to add, the 
          ", BUT...". 
        </p>
        <p>
          And if one sets out with that in mind, there is actually
          a legal construct for this, called the Public Domain. Scientists
          has used it for centuries, why wouldn't it work for us? Each
          individual who wants to commit, needs to express the desire of 
          no claim of Copyright. I think that can be done through the 
          registration process, otherwise we need to require some template
          message saying that in the commit message for it to be accepted
          into the repository. This needs some legal advice.
        </p>

      <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Open Participation in Practice</span>
        <p>
          There <em>do</em> exist a couple of threats to this model, but IMO
          the oportunities <strong>far outweighs</strong> these threats.
        </p>
        <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Best Practices</span>
          <p>
            As far as I know, this is new, so there are no best practices yet.
            We need to make it work, since we <strong>want</strong> it to work,
            and that means willingness to adapt to the situations that will 
            occur.
            However, drawing from the ASF experience I think there are some
            things we should consider;
          </p>
          <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Communication</span>
            <p>
              People is a communicative species. It is engrain in our very
              existence the need to communicate, unlike for instance apes that
              'groom' each other as mean of social networking. Mailing lists
              has many weaknesses, most importantly it has too long of feedback
              loop, so each post gets <em>'too loaded'</em> with information
              and may trigger so called flame fests. I strongly believe in IRC
              and IM as the primary tool for communication of intent, 
              discussions and suggestions, and the mailing list only for
              questions and traceability of progress.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Code Hierarchy</span>
            <p>
              It will become impossible for everyone to be part of everything,
              and many things, perhaps most things, doesn't even affect me. So
              if the codebase has some form of hierarchy, that is reasonably
              easy to understand, each individual will have different levels
              of interest in each leaf node, and <strong>should</strong> then
              monitor any changes in the codebase in the branches leading to
              these nodes, and take on an active review role to make sure the
              changes looks good. By such recommendation, more and more people
              will be responsible the nearer the top you get, which should
              ensure higher level of quality, minimizing risks of breaking
              compatibility, correct level of functionality and probably many
              other aspects of evolution.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Code Ladder</span>
            <p>
              Orthogonally to the hierarchy, which will probably be a notion
              and not a rule, I think it is reasonable to have some form of
              code ladder. Any new piece of code starts in 
              <em>experimental</em> level where the piece is developed 
              initially by one or many people, and when it is operational 
              is promoted to <em>preliminary</em> level where others can 
              actually use it. Then I think that if it attracts enough 
              <strong>flock</strong> and they can iron out any issues, it is 
              promoted into a <em>optional</em> level and becomes part of the
              recommended set of options to the average user. Once it is
              tried on the field, it may be moved up to the <em>stable</em>
              level, sending the signal to the users that there are no known
              issues. Finally, certain pieces could enter <em>frozen</em>
              meaning that no changes will be made, either due to an API that
              can't be changed or that some other system has taken its role. 
              The question is, would the code ladder have <strong>formal
              requirements</strong> of development, which would require a lot
              of tool support, or is the flock a guarantor enough to ensure
              the recommendation is followed. I think the latter is 
              sufficient.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Spammers, Vandalism and Saboteurs</span>
          <p>
            I am talking about the similarity of Wiki spam and such, not 
            determined attacks to shut us down. I call it spam and spammers
            from now on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think there are a couple of mechanisms that can prevent this.
            First of all, compared to Wiki, one needs quite a bit more 
            knowledge in development to have subversion installed and know
            how to operate it against our repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, we have a registration system, so that we at least have
            a valid email address after the fact. Not much but adds a little 
            bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly, we need a good notification and archiving system. I have
            in mind that all commits, irregardless of size, are notified to
            everyone, and stored in a mail archive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourthly, we probably need a commandline utility which you give
            a svn revision number and it removes the change made from the
            previous revision to that one. Effectively, make it easier to
            revert the change than make the change.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection"><span class="subsection-header">Troublemakers</span>
          <p>
            Troublemaker is someone who is highly active in the community,
            but doesn't have the collective trust to be part of the 
            collective decision making process.
          </p>
          <p>
            My take on this at the moment is that if the "Cost of Change"
            is higher than the "Cost of Reversal", the collective has an
            extreme advantage, in that not only is it less of trouble for
            the individual who makes the reversal, but also the scale
            factor of the flock. Meaning, if a trouble making individual
            is trying to commit changes against the collective, he/she
            will soon give up, since it requires too much energy to fight
            the flock. Also, if the individual is gathering supporters, i.e.
            his/her own flock, then just point out the procedure of going
            through the Code Ladder and allow the fork. If it is good, the
            main flock will replace it when the change has matured.
