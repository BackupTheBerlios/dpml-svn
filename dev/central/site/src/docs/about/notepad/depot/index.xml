      <p>
      Depot is an application that provides support for (a) application 
      deployment services, and (b) preferences management for humans. 
      Depot requirements are focused on the management concerns related 
      to <a href="../freight/index.html">Metro FT</a>.  Initially this 
      scope is closely related to Transit configuration via 
      <a href="prefs.html">Depot Preferences</a> but is 
      intended to grow to include remotely accessible preference 
      management and ultimately runtime management for FT based 
      applications via <a href="station.html">Depot Station</a>.
