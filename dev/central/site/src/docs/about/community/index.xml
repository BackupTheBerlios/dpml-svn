      <p>
        The community initially started with a group from the Apache Avalon
        community, spearheaded by Stephen McConnell, Peter Neubauer and 
        Niclas Hedhman. You can read more about the <a href="history.html">
        history here</a>. The basic principles of the community includes;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lower the bar for people to participate. Open Participation 
          Software was coined, to communicate that everyone is welcome to
          join in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flock of bird metaphor. If you are active in the community, we call
          it "to fly". If you fly, you are part of the decision making process 
          of where to head next.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extreme commercial friendliness. Of course using the Apache License
          for all products released, but also to work towards goals that are
          of interest of companies, such as providing commercial support, 
          development engagement of particular features for
          a fee and general consultancy around the products.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="people/index.html">people</a> in the community is trying
        to refine the <a href="process/index.html">process</a> as we go 
        along.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are working towards the creation of a non-profit organization,
        which we anticipate to get incorporated in Q1-2005. This will allow
        us to engage in more formal activities and accept monetary 
        contributions, for instance to 
        establish better infrastructure, marketing materials and much more.
