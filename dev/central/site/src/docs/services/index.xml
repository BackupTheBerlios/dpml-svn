            what most Open Source projects offer as the only support available.
            That means mainly through mailing lists and the helpful individuals
            on those lists. The core developers at DPML also help out as much as
            they can, trying to balance support with product development, and 
            other tasks required to run the project.

            average help desk, and each developer will only commit a small 
            number of subscribers, to ensure the high level of support provided.
            The developer will not only respond to questions and bug reports,
            but can also implement additional features, provided they are 
            compatible with the Metro, Magic and/or Transit road map.
