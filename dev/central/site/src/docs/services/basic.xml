      <p>
        The basic support for DPML hosted products is through the community
        effort, mainly the mailing list support-dpml@lists.ibiblio.org.
        Questions and support requests will be handled on a best-effort basis
        from each member of the community willing to do so. For more information
        about the mailing lists, <a href="/about/resources/lists.html">check this
        page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with all Open Source projects, you can not be guaranteed any help
        from the core developers, and other users may not be able to help
        you out. The core developers take pride in trying to help out as much
        as possible and answer questions that may arise, but they also need
        to further this project as well as put food on the table, so your
        question may take a day or two before being attended to.
