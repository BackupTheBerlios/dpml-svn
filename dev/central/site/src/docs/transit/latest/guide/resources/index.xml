        <p>
          Transit is a light-weight solution to a common problem. Transit allows
          almost any existing application to access centrally located resources,
          without having the application knowing the location of these resources,
          yet have the resources cached locally for performance reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a number of public central repositories on the Internet today, most
          notably 
          <a href="http://repository.dpml.net/classic">http://repository.dpml.net/classic</a>, 
          <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven">http://www.ibiblio.org/maven</a> and
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/java-repository">http://www.apache.org/dist/java-repository</a>.
          But it is very easy to set up and configure your own central repository.
