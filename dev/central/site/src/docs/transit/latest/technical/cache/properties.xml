      <p>
        The transit system stores the downloaded resources
        on your local file system. The cache provides DPML-enabled
        applications with quickly retrieval of required resources.
      </p>

      <p>
        When requested by your application, a cache manager will first
        check the local cache for the required resource.
        If the resource is not available in the local cache, the cache manager
        will then query each remote repository defined under the
        <a href="../hosts/index.html">host configuration</a> until the
        resource is resolved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Requests to remote repositories are conducted sequentially in order of
        priority, with the highest priority value queried first.
      </p>
