            The uri of the application launcher to be used. This value is normally 
            set by the transit commandline script. The value declared under the script
            is the artifact uri <code>"@TRANSIT-PLUGIN-URI@"</code>.  The loaded plugin is required
            to handle the cli options described below.

      <p>
      The transit application launcher evaluates the supplied commandline arguments
      and processes only those arguments applicable to itself.  Remaining arguments 
      are forwarded on to the application that is the target of a launch request.
      </p>

      <p>
        The standard CLI Options recognized by the launcher are listed in the following table.
      </p>

          <tr>
            <td>-load</td>
            <td>plugin uri</td>
            <td>
                Transit loads the (single) plugin from the supplied artifact URI.
                If the plugin is an instance of <code>java.lang.Runnable</code>, it 
                will be started by the controller using the <code>start()</code>
                method. A shutdown hook is added to the newly loaded plugin to 
                enable clean shutdown together with the transit instance.
                <br/><br/>For example, Metro is started via:
                <br/><code>transit -load @METRO-PLUGIN-URI@</code>
