      <p>
        In addition to the classic protocol handling, Transit provides support
        for the deployment of a runtime application via the 
        <a href="@TRANSIT-DOCS-PATH@/net/dpml/transit/Main.html">
        Transit Main</a> handler class.  This class looks for the 
        "dpml.transit.bootstrap.uri" system property and value corresponding to 
        a uri of a bootstrap plugin that handles the deployment of application
        plugins (the bootstrap uri may be overriden with the -Xbootstrap cli 
        argument in command-line scenarios).

             the loading and deployment of application plugins such as 
             the metro component managment platform cli handler and other 
             application handlers.</td>
