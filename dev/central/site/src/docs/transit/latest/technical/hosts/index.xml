      <p>
      Transit uses artifact uris to identify a resource. These identifiers 
      are in turn mapped internally to a repository url (i.e. mapping 
      identity to a location).  Locations are defined relative to one or 
      more hosts.
      </p>
        
      <p>
      Each Transit host declares a base url, an implementation strategy
      (typically dealing with uri to url mapping), and policies concerning 
      the handling of timestamped resources.
      The Transit <a href="hosts.html">hosts configuration</a>
      enables the declaration of local file based repositories and remote 
      repositories accessible via http and https protocols. Host 
      configurations may also be declared using <a href="properties.html">
      properties</a>.  In both cases the source of the <a href="authorative.html">
      authorative configuration</a> may be managed locally or centralized under
      a remote location.
      </p>

      <p>
      Example of artifact retrival and remote repositories are included in 
      the <a href="/guide/transit/@TRANSIT-BUILD-ID@/resources/index.html">Transit Guide</a>.
