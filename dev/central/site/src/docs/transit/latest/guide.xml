      The <a href="/guide/transit/index.html">Transit User Guide</a> is located 
      under the top-level <a href="/guide/index.html">DPML Guide</a>.  The guide 
      provides several examples of resource retrival, classloader creations and 
      plugin management.  The guide is structured in two sections - the first 
      addresses the subject of <a href="/guide/transit/@TRANSIT-BUILD-ID@/resources/index.html">
      resource management</a> and the second section deals with the general
      subject of <a href="/guide/transit/@TRANSIT-BUILD-ID@/plugins/index.html">plugin management</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Questions concerning guide content should be posed to the 
      <a href="/about/resources/lists.html">DPML Support mailing list</a>.
