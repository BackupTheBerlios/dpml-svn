      <p>
The Metro system is a container that provides comprehensive support for the management of complex component based systems based on an underlying meta-model that facilitates automated assembly and deployment of components.
      </p>

      <p>
Metro aims to simplify the process of managing component-based systems.  It achieves this objective through delivery of functionality supporting automated component assembly and deployment combined with strong support for the isolation of implementation from the service that a component provides. Applications are implemented through component composition. In turn, applications can be exposed as simple components and used by other components as building blocks.
