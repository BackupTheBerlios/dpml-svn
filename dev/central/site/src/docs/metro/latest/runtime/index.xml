        <p>
Metro provides support for constructor based injection of lifecycle artifacts, or optional phased delivery under which a component is processed through a series of lifecycle stages.  Lifecycle processing involves the execution of a series of stages such as associating a logging channel, applying a configuration or component parameters, setting the runtime context, supplying dependent services, initialization, startup, shutdown and disposal.  Within the Metro system, lifecycle stages can be extended or modified through association of other components that provide lifecycle support.  Metro distinguishes these services as deployment dependencies as distinct from classic runtime dependencies.
