        <p>
A deployment specification is represented by a &lt;container&gt; XML element directive.  The directive presents a deployment scenerario to the runtime containment model and through this process, defines a composite component model based on a series of subsidiary containment and component diectives. Each containment directive represents a composite component solution.  Each component directive represents an implementation deployment directive designed to fulfill a particular application scenario.
        </p>

        <p>
In structural terms, a &lt;container&gt; elements contains a set of components, sub-containers, and includes that make up the compostion a block in terms of its internal functionality.  This functionality is in turn exported through optional service directives declared at the level of the &lt;container&gt;.
