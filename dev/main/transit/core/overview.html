  A repository enabled application is an application the leverages a local
  cache of artifacts that are referenced by logical identifiers.
</p>
<p>
  Identifiers typically reference content in the form of an artifact url such
  as artifact:block:dpml/http/dpml-http-server#123. These
  identifiers disassociate the definition of an application from the source of
  the resources needed to build and deploy the application. Repository enabled
  applications leverage a local cache management system to resolve artifact
  references to physical resource based on configuration data that is defined
  independently of particular applications.
</p>

<P>
  An application will normally make content requests to a local cache manager
  which in turn interacts with one or more remote repositories to resolve
  application requests. Varying levels of quality of service are provided by
  repository systems, for example, a local cache manager can provide a level
  of control over which repositories are accesses and provide content
  validation. In addition, intelligent remote repositories can provide advanced
  solutions including automated generation of artifacts relative to cache
  manager requests, content filtering, referral management, and solutions
  customized relative to client identity.
